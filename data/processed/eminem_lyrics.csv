Rap God

[Intro]
""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?"

Killshot

[Intro]
You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

[Outro]
You fuckin'—oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you"

Godzilla

[Intro]
Ugh, you're a monster

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

[Verse 3: Eminem]
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

[Outro: Eminem]
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha"

Lose Yourself

[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

You can do anything you set your mind to, man"

The Monster

[Intro: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Bridge: Rihanna & (Eminem)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'

Lucky You

[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice"

The Ringer

[Intro]
*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date."" — ""Looks like an olive to me.""
""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists.""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners"

River

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run"

Venom

[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', ""L-L-L-Let us in!""
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the—

Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em

And I'm not knowin' when I'm

Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

Stan

[Produced by Mark the 45 King]

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 3: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you

[Outro]
Damn…"

Berzerk

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 2: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls

[Scratch]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Chorus 2: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vials"

Without Me

[Intro: Obie Trice]
Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks (*record scratch*)

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking ""this shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

We are not alike, there's nada like us on the mic (Yah!)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9""]
I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doin' chick joints
Probably rob these little dudes at fist point
'Member everybody used to bite Nickel
Now everybody doin' Bitcoin
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups
On them uppers-and-downers (Woo!)
I'm into stuff like doublin' commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up and then bust the shit down
When the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hirin' strippers, prostitutes retirin'
We can spit it for your advance
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants

You say you're affiliated with murderers, killers (Ayy!)
The people you run with are thuggin' (Gang!)
But you just a wannabe gunner (Gang!)
Like you was gonna do somethin'
Actin' like you catchin' bodies (Ayy!)
And you got juice, lil' youngin', you buggin'
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Bitch, you ain't plugged into nothin'
Rap God spit lyrical bullets (Pew!)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put a

Roll up with your (Gang!) you're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better⁠—{gun cock}⁠—have arms if you're gonna pull up (Skrrt!)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself
He wants to keep up his tough demeanour
So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun
And I'm talkin' to you
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfuckers
But just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock demi-god
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artille—ry, Godzilla harsh with a hard shell
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I lost
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off
And you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'll be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I blow 80 holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows
And I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
I double-edge sword it 'cause one place I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identical—but not us
The only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woah!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us—

Fall

[Intro: Eminem & Justin Vernon]
(Photoshoot!)
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Look)

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up!""—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a ******, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Ha-ha)

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Ha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall… bitch! (Yeah)

The Real Slim Shady

[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Outro]
Ha ha, I guess there’s a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let’s all stand up!

’Till I Collapse

[Intro: Eminem]
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Outro: Eminem, Nate Dogg, Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me"

Kamikaze

[Intro]
(Fack) Okay, (Fack) how do I say this? (Fack)
Last year (Fack) didn't work out so well for me (Fack)
(Fack last year!) (Fack) (Last year can eat a dick!)
2018, (Fack) well (Fack)

[Verse 1]
Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G ""Duck Alert""
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, ""FACK"" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Verse 2]
I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, ""FACK"" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should'a let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Interlude]
Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze (kamikaze)
Take a look at what I've done

[Verse 3]
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is

[Verse 4]
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?), 12 inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G ""Duck Alert""
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray-on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot"

Walk on Water

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote ""Stan"""

Love the Way You Lie

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire

[Chorus: Rihanna *& Eminem*]
*Just gonna* stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Bad Guy

Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryna soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this.""
Heart's saying, ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset.""

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 2]
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the picture
So long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 3]
I've been driving around your side of this town
Like 9 fricking hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential—I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now – wait, here comes my favorite lyric
""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die""
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car""
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!

[Verse 4]
I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on ya, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standard you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
'Fore it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh, as we pick up where the last Mathers left off"

8 Mile: B-Rabbit vs Papa Doc

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up! Look, look...
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
One, two, three, and to the four
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfucking MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, ""Fuck the Free World!""
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me

Mockingbird

[Intro]
Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But ayy
What'd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (Heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Post-Chorus]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)"

Not Afraid

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryna get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"

Headlights

[Produced by Emile Haynie & Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave!""
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & Eminem]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life"

No Love

[Intro: Haddaway, Eminem, & Lil Wayne]
Love, love
Love, love, love
[Mumbling chorus]
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
Young Money, yeah
No more
Love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Haddaway]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's ""Fuck the world,"" get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (No love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
That's right, it don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (No more)
Get 'em!

[Verse 2: Eminem, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (Yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (Yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (Yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (Haha)
Man, get these wack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (Oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (Yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (Yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (Yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (Yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (Yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (Shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (Shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (Ow!)
And you can never break my stride (Nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you

Survival

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die

So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

Beautiful

[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Outro]
Yeah, to my babies: stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world: God gave you shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are, and even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful"

Greatest

[Intro]
Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (Yeah)
Sayin’ I should quit (Ah)
I fuckin' tell 'em make me (Bitch)
Eat a fuckin’ dick (Yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (Woo!)
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I’m turnin’ back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia’s an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin’ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause, damn it, I'm still the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
So you sold ten million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out ten million albums, eh? (Haha! Wait)
What was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, ""DIE ANTWOORD!""
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took
And rappers I hear you talkin' shit
I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
And I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips, got the sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Brr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (Woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
Anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I knew one day (Hey!) I'm gonna be the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest"

When I’m Gone

[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and ""Thank you all for comin' out""
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
""But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?""
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
""But baby, wait!"" – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

Cleanin’ Out My Closet

[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prob'ly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems
Victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now
And it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick
He's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"

My Name Is

[Produced by Dr. Dre]

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady, you a basehead"" (Uh-uh)
""Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole""

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady"

Love Game

[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Something's burnin', I can't figure out what (Out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of (Love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
‘Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts—brace!
Hope it ain't, ""Here we go, yo!""
‘Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place (Ah, fuck)
But you confirmed my low-end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
""No, (*slurp*) you don't (*slurp*) under— (*slurp*) —stand, (*slurp*)
I (*slurp*) don't (*slurp*) do this for (*hic*) anyone, (*hic*) ever (*slurp*)""
Yeah, that ain't what they all say?
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé
'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwamé
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
‘Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the—

Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And I told her, ""Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!""
And I told her, ""Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!""

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch, ""I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick""
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
""Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me—fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day!"" (*Phone hangs up*) Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', ""I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasin' her""
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the—

[Pre-Chorus: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (with Eminem)]
(She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more)
(She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more)
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And I told her, ""Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!""
And I told her, ""Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!""

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché
It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' seventy-three, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's layin' next to me in bed—directly aimin' a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, ""Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab""
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, ""Hit the road"", then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, ""Be careful driving
Don't read this and have an accident""
She glanced to look at it and wrecked (*Car crashes*)
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin', ""Rape!""
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though
You're late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of— (*Message sound*)
Wait, ""dinner at eight""? I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the—

Game of love, love, love, love

Superman

[Intro: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Mhmmm *inhales*
You high, baby?
Yeah
Yeah?
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked—bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 3: Eminem]
First thing you say: I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
""Rot In Pieces,"" uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow

Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world

The Way I Am

[Segue from ""Steve Berman (Skit)""]
...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

Legacy

[Intro: Polina]
Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
‘Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed ‘cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
‘Cause he said that I eye-balled him

[Pre-Chorus: Polina]
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words

[Chorus: Polina]
‘Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
‘Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
‘Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, ""That's right, fight's on, bitch!""
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
‘Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
‘Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
‘Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'
'Til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my—

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy"

Unaccommodating

Oh, this what we doin'? Alright
M.A

[Verse 1: Young M.A]
I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it, shake it, break it, break it, uh
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)
And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (She came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real
It's the broke lingo (Huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (Ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)
Do right and kill er'body, Drake mode (Hello)
Bitch, I'm tryna eat out, take your plate mode (Hello)
Disrespect that life and I'm in gang mode (Grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (Huh)
I'm in cake mode (Huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up, Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (Facts)
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (Drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)
Collect pesos (Huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (Hey)
When the pain leaves (Huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Game over, Thanos on you H-O's
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)
Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
You're gonna need three squads of police officers at least to come pull me off of it and I don't stop
Please, dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim, better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple, I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling ""Bombs away"" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting

[Chorus: Eminem]
They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, I don't see why they hate me (Huh?)
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy (What?)
They call me Kanye crazy (Yah)
APESHIT, Beyonce, Jay-Z (Woo)
And I'm back with Andre, baby (Yeah)
And the doctor's operating (What?)
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K. Dot to Shady
Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo can put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal, that is a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapsed

[Chorus: Eminem]
They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating"

Space Bound

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, ‘cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, ‘cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil — spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like
Tryin' to start over, I got a hole in my heart
But some kind of emotional roller coaster
Is something I won't go on
So you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a—

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, ‘cause I'm a—

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

[Bridge: Eminem]
And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, ‘cause I'm a—

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you, without you"

Like Toy Soldiers

[Intro]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down...

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it
My crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it that I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, that's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause—

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated—it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up
'Cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
But we still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience
'Cause—

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers"

Guts Over Fear

[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called “Hi! My Name Is” dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
‘Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
""Do I really belong in this game?"", I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it… ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to—

[Pre-Chorus: Sia, Eminem]
I was a, afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found (My dreams)
I didn't wanna go another round (Yeah)
An angry man's power will shut you up (Agh!)
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run (Yeah)

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear (The time is near)
Guts over fear (Might shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down (Now I got)
Guts over fear, guts over fear

[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I know what it was like, I was there once
Single parents, hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park? Oh
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
‘Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song
But I'd rather make “Not Afraid 2”
Than make another motherfucking “We Made You,” ah
Now, I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
‘Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, Ma, ‘cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt—and eat their fucking faces off!
The legend of the angry blond
Lives on through you when I’m gone, and to think I was a—

[Pre-Chorus: Sia, Eminem]
I was a, afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found (My dreams)
I didn't wanna go another round (Yeah)
An angry man's power will shut you up (Agh!)
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run (Yeah)

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear (The time is near)
Guts over fear (Might shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down (Now I got)
Guts over fear, guts over fear"

Sing for the Moment

[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away"

Gnat

They say these bars are like COVID (Bars are like COVID; what?)
You get 'em right off the bat (You get 'em right off the bat; yeah)
Infected with SARS and Corona (Infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (You took a bite off of that; damn)
And it goes from martian to human (From martian to human; yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (That's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (At me with machine guns; brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat

[Verse 1]
Still stackin' my chips, hoes
Higher than Shaq on his tiptoes
Atop the Empire State Buildin'
This shit is like child's play, childrеn
I will anni-nihilate, kill them
I'll fuck around and pile еight million
Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then
I'll await my trial date 'til then (What?)
Ain't nothin' you say could ever trump (Nah), mic, pencil get killed (Yeah)
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (Chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed (Haha, yeah, hold up)
And I'm still ride or die for the squad (Yeah)
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl
But not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog (Fight in the dog)
Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw
And rip it off with one swipe of the paw
Bitch, you still on my dick or nah? (Nah)
If I suck, your wife is a straw (Straw)
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough 'cause

[Verse 2]
And d.a. got that dope he sends to me (Uh-huh)
It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly
Which is what separates my flow from theirs
So that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
So vocalistically (What?), that's social distancing (Yeah)
Flow going viral, you best stay strapped
With that Lysol and get way back (Shh)
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch, back the fuck up like fifteen yards, these rhymes call for a face mask (Face mask)
'Nother fourteen-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything
This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (Damn)
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem
Like they just keep getting more extreme
Who knows when this nightmare will end (Marilyn)? Like Monroe, Norma Jean (Norma Jean)
Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (Dope) and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (Nope)
For some semblance of normalcy
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (Yeah)
The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare
Mom fed me Valium like air (Mmm)
Thought that's why they called it a high chair (Woah)
I got a contact like eyewear (Woah)
Wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here (Uh)
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's
Like, fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Woah, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T.​
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault (A salt)
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river (Dope)
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

[Chorus]
They say these bars are like COVID (Bars are like COVID; what?)
You get 'em right off the bat (You get 'em right off the bat; yeah)
Infected with SARS and Corona (Infected with SARS and Corona)

And it goes from martian to human (From martian to human; yeah)

Marshall Mathers

[Intro]
You know, I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around
Like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me, ten-million dollars?
Get the fuck outta here

[Chorus]
You see, I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)

[Verse 1]
Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wristwatches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Startin' shit like some twenty-six-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill *NSYNC, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wilin' out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken?

[Bridge]
New Kids on the Block suck a lot of dick
Boy, girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it (Hahaha)

[Verse 2]
Vanilla Ice don't like me (Uh-uh), he said some shit in Vibe to spite me (Yo)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (Haha)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' ""I don't care, just bite me!"" (Na-na)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer ( hehe)
And call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (Fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out (ahh)
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck — blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
""Slim Anus""? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (You talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (Assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (Best shot at me)

[Verse 3]
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy""
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten-million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, [your attorney Fred Gibson’s a] faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Ugh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got ninety-some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uh, here, ""XXL! XXL!""
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Aw, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)
Because I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)"

Stronger Than I Was

[Verse 1]
You used to say that I'd never be
Nothin' without you, and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!""
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease
You're just fucking with me, and you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sick
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you!""
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 2]
A beautiful face is all that you have
‘Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!""
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothin', nothin' for me
So, please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you!""
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 3]
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide
That you caused, ‘cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But I'm breakin' out of this slump I'm in
Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all—fuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done bein' your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now—so I put 'em in a verse to lay

[Bridge]
And I thank you (Uh), ‘cause you made me (Uh)
A better person than I was
But I hate you (Uh), ‘cause you drained me (Uh)
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me (Uh), you're crazy (Uh)
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you!""
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was"

Believe

[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?"

Kill You

[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]

[Intro]
When I was just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized she was the crazy one
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

[Verse 1]
They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more (Ahh)
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til them vocal cords don't work in her throat no more? (Ahh)
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' this shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (Ahh)
Put your hands down, bitch—I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you (Ahh)
Shut up, slut! You're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut—okay, Ma?
""Oh, now he's raping his own mother
Abusing a whore, snorting coke
And we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?""
You're goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, *vrin vrin vrin!*
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

[Pre-Chorus]
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me

[Chorus]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through Hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't ""acid rap,"" but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint?
No, just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch, I'ma kill you! I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Three or four times in a tub, but that's normal, ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hiding murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours: let us in

[Pre-Chorus]
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me

[Chorus]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

[Verse 3]
Know why I say these things?
'Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These 80Gs a week to say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to outta school
I don't even believe in breathin'
I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from OJ
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me!

[Pre-Chorus]
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you!

[Chorus]
You don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why not?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

[Outro]
Ha-ha-ha, I'm just playing, ladies
You know I love you"

Evil Twin

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
Tryna figure out the difference
But I think—think the lines are starting to get blurred

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimmin' every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
‘Cause I'm mentally rearrangin' his face
I need a change of pace
‘Cause the pace I'm workin' at's dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey
And started slowly roastin' 'em
‘Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings
I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt you—aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes, and the Drakes
I'm frustrated ‘cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm goin' all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is, I'm strapped for battle
Suck a duck, crawl out the back—it's a bar fight
Prepare your arsenal
And beware of bar stools flyin' through the air and bottles breakin', mirrors also
And I ain't stoppin' 'til the swear jar's full
""You done called every woman a slut but you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall"" (Palin)
Oh, my bad, slut! And next time I show up to court
I'll be naked and just wear a law suit
Judge be like, ""That's sharp
How much that motherfucker cost you, smart-ass?
You're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker!
You're so fuckin' gravy, Marshall, I should start callin' you 'au jus'
‘Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo""
Evil Twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change but only for the worse
I coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse—so satanic
K-Mart chains panic ‘cause they can't even spin back the curse words
‘Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
Rekcufrehtom! (Rape your mother)— Tihs! (Kill your parents)
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screamin', ""Fuck! Shit! Fuck!""
Adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like, ""Merits?
Fuck that! I'd rather be loud, and I like swearin'""
From the first album even the gals were like, ""Tight lyrics, dreamy eyes!""
But my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches to make sure I keep up with my competition (Haha)
Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies

[Hook: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
There's darkness closing in (Evil twin), there it goes again (My evil twin)
It controls my pen (My evil twin), but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend (Evil twin) who pops up now and again (Evil twin)
So don't blame me (Evil twin), blame him, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)

[Interlude]
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Nah, F with Christina
I ain't fuckin' with either Jessica neither: Simpson or Alba
My album's just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve, or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3s
Feel like I'm burnin' to death, but I'm freezin'
Bedridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again, like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger
My suicide note's barely legible; read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch! Give up my dick for pussy?
I'll be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
Golly wolly, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 19946 Dresden it was definitely in my destiny
When on the steps, I met DeShaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap
Used to mop floors, flip burgers, and wash dishes
While I wrote rhymes, tryna get props for 'em
‘Cause I took book smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleepin', I made 'em stop snorin'
Made 'em break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blarin' through my car windows
Leanin' on the horn, screamin', ""Fuck the police,"" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin
So who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him, and I'm nuts
Then again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (Evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in; what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney
Jeez, just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
‘Cause I'm so sick of bein' the truth
I wish someone'd finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, Jo-
-se Baez couldn't beat this rap—O.J., no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho (Hey ho!)
I sound like I'm tryna sing the fuckin' chorus to ""Hip Hop Hooray""
No, I’m hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-8
And I (base) whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?
You tryin' to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm lookin' for romance ‘cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke ‘cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
‘Cause we are the same
Bitch"

Uh

All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore if he gangbangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet, he F with me
That G shall surely see, he definitely as 'bout it
As retail fraud, he's weak, the honest gesture
The trigger finger round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' round shootin' my biopic in my autobiography Range Rover
This ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' make-up, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles'll air his coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My pair'll shoot, like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life; call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent-free (Real talk!)
I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea (That's Nickel)

[Verse 2: Big Sean, Trick Trick]
Boy, I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
Hundred percent cut; no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit, where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man, them bullets will still be at your ass firin' (Brr, brr)
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy, I hit the beat, and just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self-made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy, so I put my dog in the 'Vette (Swerve)
Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand, then the ball in the net (Net)
Bitch, I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me (Me)
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me (Me)
I'm over-respected
My mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway
Now my closet fifty shades of grey
26, and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church, tryna get a little savings, yeah, a coupon (God)
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Takin' down my number, like, ""You still ain't got a new line?""
(You still ain't got a new line?)
Nah, it's the same, we been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months
But fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach, with dreams of bein' a Beatle
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place
Where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel (Let's go,) il' bitch!

[Chorus: Dej Loaf & Trick Trick]
Tell 'em, if they want it
They can come get that (Static)
I swear I love my city
I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me
They ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
‘Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder, then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo' ass not rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
So, nigga, I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Have K's in front of your school, but I ain't goin' to Kettering
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross-eyed like Bernstein’s son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against
The world, like it was before my life became a movie and they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refill of
Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio—eat a dick!
I still never ABC this shit
Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' these streets
I swear that I would stay here still
And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here
And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from
On a rampage too crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch?
‘Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's ragin' and heated and
On the way to go beat his kid?
On a track get spanked like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features and them cyphers on BET, ‘cause if
I wasn't me I prob'ly wouldn't
Wanna play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
Hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MC's just bit off more than they can chew
Like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and geniusness inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
May consider tryna reinsulate your windows
May be in for another crazy winter
‘Cause so cold in the D, it is
As days begin to tick away, but ain't this really
What made me into the angry bitter blonde?
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs?
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit
Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin'
It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With a potato peeler
And mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
Or the Bermuda Triangle and
Attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us…

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em, if they want it
They can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city
I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me
They ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Outro: Trick Trick]
What up though? It's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody!!
Hey, Em, let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little homies get this remix crackin'!
Detroit! Okay!

Untouchable

Pt. I

[Intro]
Hands up, officer don’t shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it’s no use
We ain’t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

[Verse 1]
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Verse 2]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where’d you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

Pt. II

[Verse 3]
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can’t escape the sirens
Don’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we’re trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil’s face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we’re guilty ‘cause we’re black
""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
Single mother strugglin’ through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the ""Land of the Free"" that made people slaves to build"

Darkness

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Verse 1]
Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium, then chase it with booze
One little taste, it'll do
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)
That's a lot of shots, huh? (Double entendre)
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Verse 2]
Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a benzo
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo (Hello, darkness, my old friend)
'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud
But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait, is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
Then something told me relax
And just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack
You can't murder a show nobody's at (Hello darkness, my old friend)
But what if nobody shows? Panic mode
'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions (Hello, darkness, my old friend)
The press is 'bout to go ape shit, bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium, fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore (Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Verse 3]
People start to show up, time to start the show up
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin', but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over
No suicide note, just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Outro]
Yeah, we do have some breaking news from the Associated Press right now
Just gonna bring that up because we are hearing—
We have told you that the shooter is dead
And we have just learned that police are saying that the Las Vegas shooter killed himself
That is the bartender there at Mandalay Bay and I believe we're going to hear more from her
Yeah, we just wanted to share that with you
You can see behind me here, this is what he looks like
Now we did just tell you that police just earlier...
Metro was telling us that he killed himself inside the hotel room

Good morning, as we come to you on the air
We bring you breaking news, a school shooting (Crushing news)

Criminal

[Intro]
A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? 'Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal! You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal! Yeah, I'm a criminal!

[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's yes
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (Ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
""Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it? Checkin' the male?""
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax, guy! I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
""Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital""
Preacher, preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing 'cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (Duh)
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave

[Chorus]
I'm a criminal!
'Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal!
'Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

[Verse 2]
The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word—
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-
-inem and Kim combined (The maniac's in)
In place of the Doctor 'cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place (Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal!

TELLER: Don't kill me, I've got two kids at home don't kill me!
EMINEM: I said I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you
TELLER: Don't kill me!
EMINEM: Hurry the fuck up! {*Gunshot*} Thank you!

[Verse 3]
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it (Go, go, go!)
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
The guy in it, I hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask

[Chorus]
I'm a criminal!
'Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!

And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

'Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!

How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again, I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay!)

[Verse 1: Eminem & Kim]
Don't make me wake this baby!
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, ""Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine!""
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he?

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kim]
You really fucked me, Kim, you really did a number on me!
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racin'

Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared!)
I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair! Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you! Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!)
Fuck you!
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
""Oh my God, I'm crackin' up"" Get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)  So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We coulda— hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, ""Ah! Somebody help!""
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up, and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

You fuckin' groupie
Pick up the goddamn phone

[Verse 1]
Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday? With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'd you do? Screw Dre?
You went there lookin' for me? Boo, that excuse is too lame
Keep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lyin' slut, you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? You wanna loose two legs?
You tryin' to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you, you say
""Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?"" — Well, screw you
And I'll be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, fourth—Dre, Drake, Lupe—oohm, touché
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one true-blue ace
But you ain't and I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo, you make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache
You're feeling blue? Too late, go smurf yourself
You make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead?
I would feel so much, much better

[Verse 2]
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over, but they let me go, 'cause I told 'em
I'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby, come on!
Excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on!
'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say, ""he-art""
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage
Who do you think you a-are? Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I lo-lo-lo-lo… lesbian!
Aaahhh! I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, my life'd be so much better if you just—

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead?
I would feel so much, much better

[Bridge]
'Cause you told me
You'd love me
Forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never
Wanted someone to die
So bad in my fuckin' life
But fuck it, there’s other fish in the sea

[Verse 3]
And I'ma have a whale of a time
Bein' a single sailor for the night, bitch, on a scale of
One to ten, shit, I must be the Holy Grail of
Catches, ho, I got an Oscar attached to my fuckin' name (De La)
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-made
For me, say fuck it, kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her
These bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of
My bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah, I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch, you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me: that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swingin' at this chicks on-site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid, stupid! Wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed
Oye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boy's
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink
You fuckin' pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just
Drop dead, and I'ma throw a fuckin' party after this, 'cause yes

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead (I hate you)
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head (You made me like this way)
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? (Bitch)
I would feel so much, much better

[Outro]
I'm just playin', bitch
You know I love you"

Beautiful Pain

[Intro: Eminem and Sia]
I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, ‘cause—

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half
You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter
It's like an enormous asthma
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poked its eye out with the thornbush that ya
Used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
Stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But every day's a new learning curve as you steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
‘Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket
But you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past
Standing at inferno and chant—

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're so familiarized
With what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
‘Cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive
Which means you will survive
Although today you may weep ‘cause you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and
Hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow, you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive 'em, even after all the shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burnin' quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof
Flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin'
You look down, ‘cause you're so over 'em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

[Bridge: Eminem]
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream—

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Bridge: Sia]
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

[Hook: Sia]
And I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light"

I’m Back

[Chorus]
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Verse 1]
I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No), was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi""
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, ‘cause MTV was so friendly
To me, can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

[Chorus]
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (Shady!)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Verse 2]
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
(*Scratches*) My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational (*scratch*) ""Back is the incredible!""
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
""Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!""
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it.""
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em
With my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me—

[Chorus]
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Back)

[Verse 3]
I take seven {kids} from {Columbine}, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
‘Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
‘Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ahh!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
‘Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and, Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
At the same time and just say that it ain't mine—what's my name?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Outro]
Guess who's b-back, back
Gue-gue-guess who's back (hi, Mom!)
{​​*scratch*}​​ Guess who's back
{​​*scratch*}​​ Gue— {​​*scratch*}​​ guess who's back
D-12 {​​*scratch*}​​ guess who's back
Gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back
Dr. Dre {​​*scratch*}​​ guess who's back
Back back {​​*scratch*}​​ back {​​*scratch*}​​
Slim Shady, 2001
I'm blew out from this blunt (*sighs*) fuck"

You Gon’ Learn

[Chorus: White Gold]
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9""]
I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
Profitin' all for coppin' and swappin' that property out for a possible monopoly
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy
I'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
While the demons comin' out of me
Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me
Right there since '9-6, worse nightmare to side chicks, some things are just meant to be
This it for me, give my daughters a kiss for me
Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more
Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talk and reparation then I'm not against the thought of separation
While the politicians that are white and privileged ask how is this different from segregation, that's funny bro
Segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
Separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever I wanna go

[Chorus: White Gold]
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Never sold dope for no gold rope
Wanted one though, they were so dope (Yeah)
Was a have-not (Yeah) 'cause my pockets (Uh)
Didn't have knots, I was so broke
On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (Nope)
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (Yeah)
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Making you feel like you got bent over and raped
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get cold, and began to get a chipped shoulder
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate
To get 'em all bent so outta shape
Oh shit, bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
And I'm not gonna let up, treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
Dre'll tell you how I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, I
Got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling
Bumping ""Fuck Da Police"" while I fed her Rally's
This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo
I get to flippin' the mic' as a murder weapon
I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Do not let me catch you slippin'
I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you
Singin' fuck all of you in Autotune
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair
I bust my ass for this shit and I swear
It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat
That they can't even figure out where their words
Should hit the kick and the snare

[Chorus: White Gold]
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn"

Rhyme or Reason

[Intro: Sample + Eminem]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
(""What's your name?"") Marshall
(""Who's your daddy?"") I don't have one

[Verse 1]
My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle, then crashed in
The side of loco-motive with rap, I'm
Loco, it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap, ""In a spasm
Your music usually has 'em
But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan.""
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and
Thoughts are entertainin'
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seein' eye dog
Can't even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on the ram-page
Couldn't see what I wrote, I write small
It says, ""Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with whitewalls
Had a fire in my heart
And a dire desire to aspire to Die Hard.""
So as long as I'm on the clock, punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch

[Chorus]
Now sometimes when I'm sleepin'
She comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine?
Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promised land
And threaten everyone
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

[Bridge: Sample + Eminem]
(""Now, what's your name?"") Marshall
(""Who's your daddy?"") I don’t know him, but I wonder—
(""Is he rich like me?"") Ha
(""Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?"")

[Verse 2]
No, if he had
He wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad
Yeah, Dad, I'm the epitome and the prime
Example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
Falls into the wrong hands and
Makes you want to get up and start dancin'
Even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens to be rappin', blue lights flashin'
Laughin' all the way to the bank, lampin' in my K-Mart mansion
I’m in the style department
With a pile in my cart, rippin' the aisle apart but
With great power comes
Absolutely no responsibility for content
Completely despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
Beat-killing spree, Your Honor
I must plead guilty, 'cause I sparked a revolution
Rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
Of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(""Hip-hop is the Devil's music"")
Does that mean it belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, 'cause it's the—

[Chorus]
It's the time of the season
When hate runs high
And this time, I won't give it to you easy
When I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands
And torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

[Bridge: Sample + Eminem]
(""What's your name?"") Shady
(""Who's your daddy?"") I don’t give a fuck, but I wonder
(""Is he rich like me?"") Doubt it, ha
(""Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?"")

[Verse 3]
So, yeah, Dad—let's walk
Let's have us a father-and-son talk
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas I a-ppealed to all those walks
Of life, whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're rippin' out their fuckin' hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh-oh, better beware, knuckle heads!
The sign of my hustle says:
""Don't knock”, the door's broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit?
Misery loves company, please stay a minute!
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy gettin' stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mr. Mathers as advertised on the flyers, so spread the word
'Cause I'm promoting my passion 'til I'm passed out
Completely brain-dead: Rain Man
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas
I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef 'cause I hate every fuckin' thang, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryin' look for a fuckin' reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a ""Criminal!""
Ten-year-old degenerate grabbin' on my genitals!
The last Mathers LP done went diamond
This time I'm predicting that this one will go emerald! (Hehe)
When will the madness end?
How can it when there's no method to the pad and pen?
The only message that I have to send
Is: ""Dad, I'm back at it again!""

Bitch… (Who's your daddy?)"

White America

[Intro]
America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

[Verse 1]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on

[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 2]
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby (Ooh, baby!) — Look at my sales!
Let's do the math: if I was black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
""Fuck it,"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's—

[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 3]
See, the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms prob'ly would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, ""I don't like this note!""
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say ""faggot"", shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—

[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Outro]
So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the *galf*​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you, Ms. Cheney! Fuck you, Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have! Fuck you!
Ha ha ha, I'm just playin', America
You know I love you"

Stepping Stone

[Intro: Mario Resto]
Take me to the river
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Eminem]
It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof—wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group
Shoot!

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem, Mario Resto & Both]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus: Eminem]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel
And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in
Been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me, Biz, ""Rockstar"" was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET
And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem, Mario Resto & Both]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops, little drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
I just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this
To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you men
But I just can't be the guy everybody depends
On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era
I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

[Chorus: Eminem]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Outro: Eminem]
I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones"

Just Don’t Give a Fuck

[Produced by Jeff Bass]

[Intro: Frogg]
Woah, a-get yo' hands in the air
And get to clappin' 'em and, like, back and forth
Because a-this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O, the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of, um, er-

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make yo' freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, ***** the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

Infinite

[Produced by Mr. Porter & Jeff Bass]

[Intro]
Aw, yeah (It's like this, like this)
It's Eminem, baby
Back up in that motherfuckin' ass
('Til forever, 'til forever)
One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MC's, MC's)
We represent the 313—you know what I’m sayin'?
Yo, they don’t know shit about this, for the '96

[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac, in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks runs
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist 'em up and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland
I'm Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm Infinite

[Verse 2]
Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
Some fruit to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My acappella releases classic masterpieces, through telekinesis
It eases you mentally, gently
Sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm Infinite

[Verse 3]
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense and I've been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO (MO, MO, MO)
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
'Cause there's a monster real in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B, be all you can be
‘Cause once you make an instant hit, I'm tensed a bit
And tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
I'm Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat

You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it

Kings Never Die

[Produced by The New Royales]

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can hear the drummer drummin'
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone
I know something's comin'
But I'm runnin' from it, to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was?
Was it too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens?
‘Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
‘Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin, even if it means I'm sellin' my soul
Just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
‘Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that? I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark
This sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out
And I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
‘Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here
But I'm not a quitter; gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
‘Cause you're moving onto the next, but is your respect gone?
‘Cause someone told me that…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't give me that sob story, liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features
And try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be
A fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback, as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage, and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em
‘Cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say!
It just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent-up rage, ‘cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
‘Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow, and I'm not gonna be…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck
You’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope, all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again
All alone and on a throne, like a token of respect
Or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm
And launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go
I'm still not leaving, stop for no one, I don't know
But I've been told, an obstacle that blocks your road, ya
Knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, ‘cause…

[Bridge: Eminem]
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky!
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
‘Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

[Verse 4: Eminem]
So you're tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus, I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness; kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas
Still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen
But Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat, ‘cause makin' the beat
Ain’t the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that sound-bombing, Thirstin Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God, just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Outro: Gwen Stefani]

Asshole

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speakin' to children
Everything was happenin' so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
‘Cause I was gettin' sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinkin': ""If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him.""
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
‘Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, I'd just zone out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like tellin' Gwen Stefani she sold out
‘Cause I was tryna leave no doubt
In anyone's mind, one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now because everybody knows

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Interlude: Eminem]
Thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he roundabout
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, well goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhandin' a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck's all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said, ""There ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out!""
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm takin' no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changin' back into that old maniac
In fact, there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin'
‘Cause everybody knows

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed, ""ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?""
‘Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm makin' up words so you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
‘Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
‘Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
‘Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
‘Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuck father time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half-alive
Poured my half-empty glass in a cup
Now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I’m goin' back to what got me here
Yeah, cocky, and can’t knock bein' rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows"

Wicked Ways

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition
It's what you're sufferin' from when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no frickin' air conditionin'
And you can't see the bitch’s hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up, blarin' the system
In your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him givin' an adjective an ass-whoopin'
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did somethin' to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (Sniff it!)
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground, still can’t tell 'em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park
Screamin', ""I'm proud to shop at K-Mart,"" and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart, arguin' over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin', I don't give a fuck, I don't play
Bitch, you think you saw this basket first?
You're ass backwards like motherfuckin' Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gapin' hole in it, flipped out
Ripped down the drapes, tied 'em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match
And I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothin' to do with a scale
Or being gay, little faggot, but by the way
Thoughts are gettin' darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey
Tyler, the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
I'm insane, every rhyme I say
Sons you like an ultra-violet ray
I’m sellin' hatred, buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99, so come on and pile a plate!
I’m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I’m spittin' while I’m shittin' on competition
In the meantime it’s always mean time, I'm gettin'—

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I’ve been a career asshole
I don’t see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit
I was born a mistake, but I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose
Was to beat a beat purplish, slaughter tracks
I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
I’m comin' to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
'Cause that cougar's a MILF
She's the oldest trick in the book, but I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'ma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion’s Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm runnin' away with the game
It's 'cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady, you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches
Cry 'til you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leavin' on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of poundin' a square peg in a round hole
Sorry, another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gon' fit in my storage overhead space
'Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words: don't try to put your heart in a headcase
'Cause, baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines
And see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee-high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
'Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a fuckin' (fuckin') echo (echo)
(Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle, spiralin', here I go
I'm outta control like no other mic go
Stab you 'til the knife goes – dull
I'm nothin' but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'Cause I'ma sock it to you!
Dyke ho, you don't like it?
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night, so
Strike up the fuckin' maestro, I'm nitro
And hi, ho, hand me my shovel!
I'm liable to dig my hole deeper
And it's off to H-E double hockey sticks, I go

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Outro/Skit: Eminem & Ken Kaniff]
Ohh, please be empty
Please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God!
Shit… Is that a girl?
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M
And lay with eighteen guys naked
And let myself show, let myself show
Buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back!
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then!
Blow it out your ass!"

Good Guy

[Verse: Eminem]
Here we go aga-ain, from heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo but we both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still, it gave me hope that we'll get
Through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in a E-N-V-elope
Would be dope, but what kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why is she tryna act out?
She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you'd die for
Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
Another late night in, she stumbles through my door
Lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers
To plant the K-Y in, I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and who's prob'ly screwed five more
Guys, sucked eight/nine men
I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens
Bitch, it's you I tore out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for when you date my friends
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get?
I'm waitin' for the day I can
Hear you say, ""Marshall, what a skank I've been.""
""And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him.""
Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
After you, I swore to make the gray skies end
Here come the rays like when
You get a pay hike and
Am I the good guy or do I just play like him
And hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true, just to scream, ""Fuck you!""
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
Since—

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
They'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
Even though you know the real me
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I'll let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I'll let you say that you're the good guy
Play like you're the good guy
Play like, play like, play like you're the good guy"

So Far...

[Intro: Eminem]
I own a mansion but live in a house
A king-size bed but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Brightside, glass is half-full
But my tank's half empty, gasket just blew

[Verse 1: Eminem]
This always happens
Thirty minutes from home, gotta lay a log cabin
Only option I have's McDonalds's bathroom
In a public stall, droppin' a football
So every time someone walks in the john, I get maddened
""Shady, what up?"" What? Come on, man, I'm crappin'
And you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue
Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then
""Thanks, dawg! Name's Todd, a big fan""
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
Told him: ""Todd, you're the shit,"" when's all of this crap end?
Can't pump my gas without causin' an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fuckin' trash
Without someone passin' through my sub, harassin'
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask sufferin' succotash
But the ant-acid, it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
Potatoes, so what? Ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upper class?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in the cupboard, plasticware up the ass
Stuck in the past—iPod, what the fuck is that?
B-Boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass

[Chorus: Eminem & Joe Walsh]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And (Life's been good to me so far)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I'd be doin' if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned 40 and still sag—teenagers act more fuckin' mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me? I'll leave on my own terms, asshole
I'm goin' berzerk, my nerves are bad
But I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her dag
Her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged
And I heard she drag-races, *burp* swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (Yeah?) word, skag
We'd be the perfect match
'Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck's all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica, hell with
PlayStation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo, bitch! Run, jump, punch, stab, and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti
Put in on bread, make a sandwich with Welch's, and belch
They say this spray butter's bad for my health, but
I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford, and welfare
Mentality helps to keep me grounded
That's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters
Still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt, a
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves, goddamn it, to hell, I
Can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell, the
Other day, someone got all elaborate
And stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King—they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma's catchin' up with me

[Chorus: Eminem & Joe Walsh]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And (Life's been good to me so far)

[Bridge: Eminem]
Got friends on Facebook all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce, hunched over, giant nosebleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova
The show's over, I'm hidin' in Kroger, buyin' groceries
He just had front-row seats
Told me to sign this poster, then insults me
""Wow! Up close didn't know you had crow's feet!""
I'm at a crossroads, lost, still shoppin' at Costco's
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
Got caught pickin' my nose (Agh!)
Look over, see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em, stuck at the light, the fuckin' shit's
Takin' forever to change, it's stuck, these bitches are lovin' it
Rubbin' it in, chucklin', couldn't do nothin'
Play it off, ""What you bumpin'?""
""Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better,"" fuckin' bitch!
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with
Another one, after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'ma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision to fuck with, bitch
Quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
I love my city, but you pushed me to the limit—what a pity!
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin' out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
But bitch, I got an elevator in my house
Ants and a mouse—I'm livin' the dream!

[Chorus: Eminem & Joe Walsh]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And (Life's been good to me so far)"

Shake That

[Intro: Eminem]
Woo! Shady
Aftermath
(Look at that bitch!)
(Holy sh... damn!)

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Nate Dogg]
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk
Get fucked up, hit the strip club
Don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked
Get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

[Chorus 2: Nate Dogg]
(Now) Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, ah, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish, yeah
Me and Nate D-o-double-g
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna, finna have a

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nate Dogg, Eminem, Nate Dogg & Eminem]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls, they act retarded (Man, I told you [?])
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
(Now) Look at this lady all in front of me
Sexy as can be, tonight, I want a slut
Would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak, he said he wants a slut
Hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
(Now) Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, ah, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it

There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

And I ain't leavin' without you, bitch!

Phenomenal

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 1]
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 2]
Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Bridge]
Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You’re floating freely, no emotion

[Verse 3]
Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal"

Normal

[Intro]
(Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, how do I keep
(Man, I don't know what’s up with these hoes, man)
Gettin' in relationships like this?
(I'm just sayin’)
Maybe it says somethin' about me
(Yeah, yup)
Should I look in the mirror?

[Chorus 1]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together

[Verse 1]
She thinks I'm bein’ mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She’s about to let the demons out
She don't wanna see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin’ to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how—

[Chorus 2]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
I guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein’ weird's normal

[Verse 2]
And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over
Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
Up with someone so unlikable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't s'posed to agree, you fucking bitch!
'Specially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!

[Verse 3]
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window (*Beep-beep*)
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5 a.m. in the drive in a stretched white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye, so shut your pie hole

[Outro]
Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal? (Yeah)
I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?"

Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself

You can be just like me

I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

[Chorus]
Now, follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms, then OD
Now, don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Verse 2]
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

[Chorus]
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me"

Premonition (Intro)

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
So I guess this is what it is, huh?
Think it's obvious
We ain't never gonna see eye to eye
But it's funny
As much as I hate you
I need you
This is music to be murdered by

[Chorus: Nikki Grier]
Got a premonition
I feel the end is near
The beauty starts to fade
The joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind

[Verse: Eminem]
They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the fuck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or to Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)
I'm LL Cool J, Bigger and Deffer, that's how come (Uh)
I sell like four mil' when I put out a bad album (What?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically
'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V
Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy
It's your funeral, prepare to die
This is music for you to be murdered by"

Zeus

[Verse 1: Eminem]
She says I am trash, but she listens to Tekashi (Damn)
Bitch, you lost me (Yeah)
Fair weather, wishy-washy
She thinks machine washed me (What?)
Swear to God, man, her favorite rapper wish he'd cross me (Yeah)
I love conflict, got a obnoxious (What?) subconscious (Yeah)
I'm afraid to unlock it (Nah)
Keep those monsters in the closet
I'm what an idiotic ('Otic) savant is (Savant is)
But I've been throwin' down gauntlets since that underground Rawkus (Yeah)
Where I planted my roots (What? Yeah)
That's how I had a whole planet that roots for me
As in the group, and no one thinks dark as I think (Nah)
So imagine the havoc these black thoughts are to wreak (Tariq)
As in Trotter, I keep slaughterin' beats
Shout out to Beatminerz and T-Minus
But, me, long as I breathe, promise to be honest
And wholeheartedly, apologies, Rihanna
For that song that leaked, I'm sorry, Ri
It wasn't meant to cause you grief
Regardless, it was wrong of me, but

[Chorus: White Gold & Eminem]
I be on my own (Yeah), head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, ""You ain't the GOAT"", I come down like, ""Who?""
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear I can see the game from a bird's-eye view, ayy
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god, ayy
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta, ayy
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around like they don't love you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah, they woke a giant up
So when I get back on my feet, don't wonder why in the
Fuck is my head in the clouds (Nah)
G5 with the stewardess, gettin' head in the clouds (Haha)
Mile-high club (Why?), I give a flying fuck (Fly and fuck, no)
Punchliner just tryin' to survive in this climate of vaginas (Bitch)
Who dyin' to cancel my ass like Aunt Jemima syrup
I'm a shit-stirrer, you're a dime-a
Dozen, said I couldn't do it
Hit Europe, kicked the door in, put a foot through it (Ugh)
Like a stirrup (Stirrup)
Used to have to sit and watch them bills pile up (Yeah)
Now I just sit back and watch them bills pile up (Haha), but

[Chorus: White Gold & Eminem]
I be on my own (Yeah, woo), head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, ""You ain't the GOAT"", I come down like, ""Who?""
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear I can see the game from a bird's-eye view, ayy
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god, ayy
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta, ayy
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around—

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I've seen them come and go
I've seen the hugest (Hugest) debuts ('Buts)
I've had a great view to see the (See the) game through (Through)
And, Drake, they're gonna turn on you (You) one day too (Too)
And the more you win, the sooner (Sooner) they do
They'll be calling you a trash bin
Sayin' that your new one isn't better than your last and
Even if it is, once they start to turn their backs
They ain't never comin' back in
They did it to Chance
Next they'll be mentionin' Future in the past tense (Yeah)
Or sayin' ""Adiós"" to Migos
I ain't dissin', I'm just tryna keep the shit a C-note (Yeah)
Same people been tryna do the shit to me, so
I call them people (Peephole)
Because they're so easy to see through 'em (See through 'em)
But a fighter's all I knew how to be
I got the shit beat out of me (Yeah)
Tripped and fell and blew out a knee (Pop)
Popped it back in and hopped up like, ""Fuck it (Fuck it)
Best two out of three"", yeah
Man, I gotta be doin' (What?) somethin' right
I got eleven years of sobriety (Yeah)
So the only bottom I'ma be hittin' is if it's sodomy
Wait, I mean, you would think that somebody handed a saw to me (Sodomy)
How I'm choppin' these bars
They keep wantin' me to rap responsibly
When I'm constantly passin' the buck like the fuckin' Dollar Tree
But I'ma always remind you that I came from poverty
Black people saved my life, from the Doc and Deshaun
And all that we want is racial equality
R.I.P. Laquan McDonald, Trayvon, and Breonna
Atatiana, Rayshard, and Dominique
Eric Garner and Rodney King
No, we can't get along 'til these white motherfuckin' cops
Who keep murderin' Blacks are off the streets (Off the streets)
And, as far as squashin' beef, I'm used to people knockin' me
But, just not in my camp
And diplomatic as I'm tryna be
Last thing I need is Snoop doggin' me
Man, Dogg, you was like a (Yeah) damn god to me
Nah, not really (Haha)
I had ""dog"" backwards
But I'm startin' to think, all these people takin' shots at me
Shit, it's no wonder

[Chorus: White Gold, White Gold & Eminem]
I be on my own, head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, ""You ain't the GOAT"", I come down like, ""Who?""
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear I can see the game from a bird's-eye view, ayy
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god, ayy
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta, ayy
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around like they don't love you"

Guilty Conscience

[Intro: Mark Avery & Eddie]
Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

[Skit: Stan, Girl]
Come on, just come in here for a minute
I don't know
Look, look, look
Damn
Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?
O-okay
Look, give me a kiss, pull your pants off, come on

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail

[Interlude: The Isley Brothers, Mark Avery, (Grady), & Grady's Wife]
Here I lay
(Man, it feels good to be home)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?"
"[Title]
Offended

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn’t robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description, ain't nobody dippin'
Out the back of the club like, ""Oh my God, he's trippin'!""
Only time you get the blade is
Probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing
I'm still coppin' a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, poppin' a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby
A lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blond fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but 'til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And Senator Mitch McConnell’s
Just as big of a bitch as Donald—
Shit's on, bruh! (Ha-ha)
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff-arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

[Verse 2: Eminem & Paul Rosenberg]
These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam
On nanny cam, I'm gettin' handies with the zanny Xannys
In the Caddy armrest, I'm imaginin' objects
So I'm battin' cobwebs from a daddy longleg
In Hamtramck
Got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice her age and I'm actin' half it (Ha-ha)
Grow up?
Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul
Got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Klonopins
Like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled (Em…)
So's my manager
Bitch, I amateur, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me—
'Cause I don't own a mirror!
But, Marshall, you are terrific
So smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits, whiff it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives're butcher than gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into caput'cha
When I pull 'em like (What?) sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
To make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine
Waitin' in a buffet line
So, Kellyanne Conway
I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been makin' wedding plans all day

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Eight-year-old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape
'Cause you're in a slurrin' state
I’m a 10, you’re an eight (Urinate)
Like what I do before, after, and durin' rape!
You wanna get into a pissin' contest
And find out who's better?
And be made a fool out of when I pull on 'em?
R. Kelly with a full bladder (R. Kelly with a full bladder)
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college (Zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like Haloti, partner
Blow me, told you I'm so dirty, homie, you can throw me
In some holy water, with some floaties on
And get the soap and try to get the Pope to hold me
While you hose me off and, nope, I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained
Dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone (Uh-huh)
I get why you're tapped
""But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back!""
Is what I tell myself
When times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie
When life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad:
Don't cry, get mad!
'Cause little baby powders
Belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass (Sodomy!)
Foot up it, I stood up for the kid
Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (At his school)
You ain't had to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude (Attitude)
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
That's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it, then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage (Minimum wage)
But it's embedded in my head I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal or forget I was ever this incredible?
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause
I'll never get another motherfuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this, I can simply because I can

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds"

Brainless

[Intro]
Or Eminem has a full line of chainsaws
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper Eminem
""Who can say for sure? Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer. If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use, society would reap a great benefit.""

[Verse 1]
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of Tourettes
Fuck, fuck-fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors' hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches, with these hedge-trimmin' scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess
And make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
Despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a frickin' wuss, a pussy, this kid just took
My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was 12 and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell; I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's usin' your head, Momma always said—

[Chorus]
""If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous"" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
""Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous.""
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Verse 2]
Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud, gee, for what reason you stumped me?
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, beat down
And be upbeat when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start, it's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicin' trash-talkin' in a trance
Locked in my room, yeah, but I got some plans, Momma
These damn rhymes are fallin' out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it!
And I'm startin' to blend in more, in school this shit helps for sure
I'm gettin' more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore
I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch—end of story
Still, in my skull’s a vacant empty void, been usin' it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory: in this gourd there's a Ford engine
Door hinge, syringe, an orange, an extension cord, and a ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
Ironin' board, a bench, a wrench, a ore winch, an attention whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin' chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my
Head, just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I
Don't, 'cause I'd probably be Dahmer, 'cause Momma always said—

[Chorus]
""If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous"" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
""Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous.""
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Bridge]
Now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
'Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on the bottom of the pile, gettin' stomped
But somehow I came out on top

[Verse 3]
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, y'all, fuck it, I'm out cold, now everywhere I go
They scream out, ""Go!"", I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell-outs, freak the hell out Middle America
Hear 'em yell out in terror, they were so scared, and those kids
Just about belted out whatever spouted
Or fell out my smart aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate? So be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, yeah
'Til then, hopefully you little homos get over your fears and phobias
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin'— insert insult here
Who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole MC'd
Be able to take the whole culture and reupholster it?
And boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket, and still the shit got
That white-trash traffic in gridlock, shit hoppin' like six blocks
From a Kid Rock/Insane Clown Posse concert in mid-Oc-
-tober, and God forbid I see a wizard
And get a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all
'Cause I'll turn into the Unabomber, Momma always said—

[Chorus]
""If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous"" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
""Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous.""
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Outro]
""Insaneness"" ain't even a word, you stupid fuck!
Neither is ""ain't"""

The Warning

[Intro: Eminem]
Only reason I dissed you in the first place
Is 'cause you denied seeing me, now I'm pissed off

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sit back, homie, relax, in fact, grab a six pack
Kick back while I kick facts, yeah, Dre—sick track
Perfect way to get back, wanna hear something wick-wack?
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm obsessed now, oh gee
Is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I put all them phone calls out
You made to my house when you was wildin' out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you something to smile about
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin' to count
Better shut your lyin' mouth if you don't want Nick findin' out
You probably think 'cause it's been so long
If I had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixin' our studio
Session down and sendin' it to masterin' to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do; Mariah it ever occur to you
That I still have pictures? However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too, faggot, you think I'm scurred of you?
You're gonna ruin my career, you better get one
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
That made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once, yeah
What you gonna say, I'm lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you fuckin' had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick, Pumpkin?
The second week we were dry humpin', that's gotta count for somethin'
Listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk
About how I nutted early 'cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
And said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin' me
I'm embarrassin' you and don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as that song's gettin' airplay, I'm dissin' you
I'm a hair away from gettin' carried away and gettin' sued
I was gonna stop at sixteen, that was thirty-two
This is thirty-four bars, we ain't even third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah played you, Mariah who?
Oh did I say ""whore,"" Nick? I meant a liar too
Like I've been goin' off on you all this time
For no reason, girl, you out your alcoholic mind
Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it, now I'm 'bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
On an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go openin' your jibs
'Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin' this shit again, ho, you know what it is
It's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every fuckin' thing I got
Includin' the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were tryin' to stick two CDs in the same slot

[Interlude: Mariah Carey]
Slim Shady, artful dodger
Slim Shady, artful dodger

[Verse 2: Eminem & Mariah Carey]
(I love you) I love you, too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Now what you say? (It's nothing) Yeah so what I'll do
Is refresh your memory when you said (I want you)
Now should I keep goin' or should we call truce?
(You think you're cute, right?) You bet your sweet ass I do
(I'm Mary Poppins, baby) And I'm Superman, ooh
(Mary P; Slim Shady) Comin' at you
So if you'll still be my (Baby girl)
Then I'll still be your (Superhero)
(Oh and Em?) Yeah, I'm right here
(You like this) Nope, not anymore dear
It cuts like a (Knife) when I tell you get a (Life)
But I'm movin' on with mine, Nick, 'cause that's your (Wife)
Well tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone
If she don't (Stick to the script) then I'ma just keep goin'
Damn

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
I see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's saying cut the tape
Cut the tape, knife"

[Verse 3]
Okay, I'm done, I already came twice
You ain't gonna make me cum
I'm all outta gas, not so fast
Uh, your finger just went in my ass
Ow, that hurts, take it out now
Oh, wait a minute, aw
Put it back in, in-in-in
This don't mean I'm gay, I don't like men
I like boobs, boobs, boobs
Now see that gerbil, grab that tube
Shove it up my butt
Let that little rascal nibble on my asshole, uhh
Yeah, right there, right there
Ahh, I'm cumming, oh, yeah
Fack, I just came again
Okay, pull it out now, enhh
Oh, fuck yeah
Wait, he's not out, he's still crawling around up there
Ow, fuck, I think it's stuck
Ow, but it feels so fucking good

I'm gonna facking cum! (Oh, shit!)
Fack, fack, fack (Fuck, I am!)
I am, I'm going to cum (I'm cumming!)

Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube

25 to Life

[Produced by DJ Khalil & Danny Keyz]

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
Too late
(Yeah, I can't keep chasing you
I'm taking my life back)
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I woulda laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain
Bitch, you took me for granted, took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect, I demand it, I'ma take control of this relationship, command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?
Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in-depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left, I laughed while you wept
How's it feel now? Yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate, but it's…

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
(Yeah, can't take no more)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh
‘Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half till I snap
Don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still?
Man, I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you – go marry someone else and make 'em famous!
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat, I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this
So many times it's ridiculous, and still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, I'm drawn to
Shit, I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed, but this time I
Ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop! I'm leavin' you, my life sentence is served, bitch
And it's just...

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
(I'm gone, man)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
Too late
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life"

Leaving Heaven

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah (I knew this day was coming)
Sometimes, you gotta come back down (It's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Five dozen flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You're dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (Yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (What?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (Leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (Yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned, been
Countless times I've been doubted
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing, I vow to outsmart 'em and beat 'em
My God, what a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear ol' dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only guts you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade of it then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Eminem]
I'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)
Where I am going (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving Heaven (Fuck you, bitch)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know what? Maybe if I hadn't had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where I am going (Or maybe I should say, ""Thank you"")
('Cause I wouldn't have been me, haha)

[Outro: Skylar Grey & Eminem]
So you better, you better run (Yeah)
You better, you better run (So I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)
You better, you better run (Cocksucker, haha)
You better, you better run (See you in Hell)"

Those Kinda Nights

[Intro: Bizarre & Ed Sheeran]
Damn, girl, with your sexy ass, haha
Let me holla at you
D.A. got that dope
It's one of those kinda nights

[Verse 1: Eminem, Ed Sheeran, & Bizarre]
Yes, this beat’s takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up baggin' the cocktail waitress
And takin’ her straight back to the Motel-8
Yeah, Bizarre's tryna get a lap dance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (Ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like ""Goddamn""
She's like ""That's harassment,"" I'm like ""Yeah, and?"" (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That’s the best ass I’ve seen in a while
We should be datin', she’s from Cleveland
But she's a bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy (Since an addy)
She said ""Fuck off"" and threw her liquor at me
It’s one of those kinda nights
Then I said, I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda nights

[Verse 2: Eminem]
This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her et cetera
Had her like, ""Oh my God
My whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em""
I said, ""Oh my God, you know my songs?
That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on? Ah (Haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?""
She said, ""No, I'm bi""
She said, ""Are you drunk?,"" I said, ""No, I'm high
I'm checkin' out the chick,"" she said, ""So am I""
""What's in the cup, let me see that
Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at?""
She said, ""Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back""
Then I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda—

[Verse 3: Eminem]
OMG
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Said she wants to go with me
I said, ""Go with you where?"" She said, ""Out""
I said, ""I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me""
Walk her out to the parkin' lot, here comes Da Brigade
Turn like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said, ""Let's pull over,"" she said, ""No problemo""
Windows are dark tint, roll up the car windows
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Gettin' head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're ho'in
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no one
I'm high and you're bi, I'm comin', you're goin'

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda nights"

Hailie’s Song

[Intro]
Da-da, da-da
Yo, I can't sing, but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

[Verse 1]
Some days I sit starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

[Chorus 1]
'Cause sometimes (Fuck) it feels like (I was scared) the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 2]
My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes ‘cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

[Chorus 1]
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 3]
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *reh tnaw*
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
‘Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore
Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted, and—

[Chorus 2]
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

[Outro]
Wooo! Told you I can't sing
Oh, well—I tried
Hailie, 'member when I said
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?
Guess what—Daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby
I love you (​​*smooch*)​​"

Ass Like That

[Intro]
Ow, baby

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door, but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B
I sing song, it go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
If I offend, I'm sorry, please, please, forgive
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see the show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh 'cause there's a puppet on my hand (Hahaha)

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say ""ass"" and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, ""Get out, you bozo""
I need a new boyfriend, hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word ""pee-pee""
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me, please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]

Fuck is wrong with you?

Bitch Please II

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Yeah, what up, Detroit?
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh, no, he didn't
They didn't do it again (What-what, you what?)
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh, fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw, you smell that?
This is special right here (What-what, what-what-what?)
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie, baby, uh
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, ya know, what's crackin', Dre?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Just let me lay back and kick some old simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit, and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Best throw on ""Guilty Conscience"" at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious (Watch out, nigga)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard, when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me?
D.R.E. and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach (Westside)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare just bein' Andre
But I…

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Eminem]
Somehow, some way
Hello, nigga, you know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
And let me cut these niggas up and show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin', son (Yeah)
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run (Watch out)
Got about fifty guns and I love
All of 'em the same, bang-bang (Word up)
Damn, baby girl, what's your name? (What's your name?)
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)
Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem (What's up, Slim?) What up, Cuz? (What up, Snoop?)
The Great White American Hope (Uh-huh)
Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast, baby

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the façade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough, I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees
Come on

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 4: Eminem & Snoop Dogg]
Aw, naw, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls (What?), dick six-inch long (Mm)
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy!) (Ha-ha-ha)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right
To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird?
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That, somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (A .44)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Marsh

[Intro]
My name is Marsh and this world, I'm out of it (Out of it)
'Cause with all this A-B-C shit, I'm starting to sound like ALF a bit
Ha, I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was mislead by the sound of it, how am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit? (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me
To feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles
Of pills, think your boy is startin'
To feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fucking bitch to the curb
But the word ""fucking"" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is, ain't no adjective, it's a verb
Ho thinks her snatch is magical
But that's how she attracts men, though
Traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
In fact, it'll be nothin' to throw that lil' bitch with a capital B out the back window
Of the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can outrap Reynolds
A pad and pen'll be great, but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like Invisibl Skratch Piklz
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal
It's time to go bat shit, like you accidentally ate a Louisville slugger and crapped it
I'd like to introduce myself
Hi there, bitch...

[Chorus]
My name is Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
Call me extra, extraterrestrial
Extra, extra, extraterrestrial (Skrrt, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I could keep beefin', fuck is the point?
I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit
If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L
I'd rather just see you in Hell, but I should get Puff on the joint (Diddy)
Wait, run it back, I said give you an L, inhale
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid
Used to get jumped for my ProWings
When I was growing up they said a Slinky's a wonderful toy
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
""Oh, what a bundle of joy""
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
From a tantrum I was throwing
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
Once I get going, rain, thunder, it's storming
Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice
In my head, say it's still a dream
Then he said kill emcees
Trippie Redd, with pills and lean
Sipping meds in the limousine
Getting head, guillotine

[Chorus]
My name’s Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
Call me extra, extraterrestrial (Yeah)
Extra, extra, extraterrestrial

[Verse 3]
Yeah
So all of y'all can just suck a penis (Suck a penis)
I'll do the opposite (I'll do the opposite)
Eat you pussies like cunnilingus (Like cunnilingus)
There ain't no stoppin' it (There ain't no stoppin' it)
They say I'm such a genius (They say I'm such a genius)
When that Kamikaze hit (When that Kamikaze hit)
Now they call me ""butterfingers"" (They call me ""butterfingers"")
'Cause I just keep droppin' shit (I just keep droppin' shit)
You wanna butt heads? Shut up, Beavis, haha
I got your bitch with her butt out
I'm hittin' a lick 'cause she stickin' her tongue out (Bitch)
You got no hitters, you might be pitchin' a shut out
She 'bout to give up the dugout (Yeah)
I should just live in a nuthouse
Right now, I live in an igloo (Yeah)
And I'm not chillin' the fuck out
Treat you like a stepparent, does to a stepchild with red hair and
Plus I get dough like Ed Sheeran, so call me the ginger bread man
I'm a stan of Redman, X-Clan and I'm a Treach fan
But I look up to myself (Yeah)
Like a fucking headstand (Yeah)
So why, w-w-w-why else would I call myself an alien?
How could I hit a dry spell? (Yeah), I'm named after the wetlands

[Chorus]
I'm Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
Call me extra, extraterrestrial (Yeah)
My name is Marsh and, my name is, my name is
My name is Marsh"

Business

[Intro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Marshall! Sounds like an SOS
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!
To the Rapmobile—let's go!
(Marshall! Marshall!)
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show
His name is (Marshall!)
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear, fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers, Dre, holy bat syllables!
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People, when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a ""hell...""? (Hell yeah!)

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Outro: Eminem]
So there you have it, folks
(Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away
Until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night, everyone!
Thank you for coming! Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! Heh"

Just Lose It

[Intro]
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop, pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me? Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (Ah-ah), beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape""
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body

[Verse 3]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality look, it's B. Rabbit
Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-Teletubby
Fellas (What?) Fellas (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin', it's the season
Just go (Ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

Touch my body
Touch my body
Oh boy, just touch my body
I mean girl, just touch my body"

Arose

[Part I: Arose]
If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turning so definite—wait!
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, Bean, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Momma to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I've got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things—time, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset
I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Then a breath, machines go (*beep beep beep*)
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

[Part II: Castle Extended]
(I don't want it!)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider them last four minutes as
The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'
I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin'—now I know
(*Toilet flush*)"

I Will

[Intro: Eminem]
And I don't think that I can stop it (Here it comes)
I do my best to try to block it (Redrum)
I've been sipping on like, vodka (Head's numb)
I'm blacking out, you better watch it (It's bedlam)

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9""]
I'm a long way away from where you are in skill
Foreign wheels, my bitch wearin' four-inch heels
She on the orange pill
And she about to start taking off layers like orange peels
Sacha Baron Cohen, Ferrell, where am I going with this?
Oh yeah, I bar at will
And when you throw the iron in it, I'm all that still
The truth for real, I'm real true, call that trill
This is my house, this place is mine
Posted on any corner on any coast I'm on
You niggas need to leave that lean, Henny, and coke alone
Terror to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain
Student of the game pre-Kane, you niggas Post Malone
Elite beatboxer minus the raps
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
I literally keep three shottas
I'm lyrically James Todd, Tariq Trotter minus the cap

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

[Verse 2: KXNG Crooked]
Manslaughter goons under the moonlight
John Wilkes, that's who I'm in the booth like
Ayy, bruh, I go ham for dead presidents
And everything I record is over your head like a boom mic
Why would you irrelevant fucks want to rebel against us
Knowing your Smith & Wesson has never been clutched?
Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented
Them niggas that'll send you to the dentist to get a whole row of elephant tusks
Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever
I see you, my niggas call me ""The Enemy Watcher""
The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya
I'm livin' to conquer, remember the mantra, I'm grippin' the launcher
Like Em and the Doctor with no guilty conscience
I'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater
More shockin' than a pissed off Blanka

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I just finished fuckin' a fish called Wanda
I'm finna wander off into yonder
Beyond just mentally stronger, memory monster
I remember the sponsorin' thought that conquered his triple entendre
You the cross of a unicorn and The Unabomber
Quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
Your Willy Wonka persona won't help you any longer
I'm Optimus, I make prime examples of mini Tonkas
Hogtie your squad and go bonkers
Spin, grab Denaun's guitar and Honky Tonk ya
All your bars subpar like good golfers
I put a hole in one of you birdies with this Eagle and launch it (Pew)

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Now this will probably be the most illest shit that I've ever said
God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause I said, ""Motherfuck school,"" and instead went to special ed
Sippin' Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time
That I startled my mom and had her scared to death
Word to Method Man
She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio
She was like, ""What the heck was that?""
She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, ""Protect your neck""
Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
Rejoice in the sound of my voice, but you don't have a choice
Just a third of my will will overpower yours
Using about a fourth to create the amount of force
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol
Enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse
Than a forty-some bar Lord Jamar verse
Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse
You could say I swore to protect
My image, I have zero time or regard for
A never-was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
If it was anyone's house, G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors
Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
Rest of these youngins of mine
Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds
'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just sons in my eyes
Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it
Next door to an abortion clinic
Newborn infants tortured and tormented
With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
Their corpses get ornamented
The coroner with a storage bin rented
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
This is only the beginning
So, Lord, forgive me, I'm hearing voices
I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

[Outro: Eminem]
And I don't think that I can stop it (Here it comes)
I do my best to try to block it (Redrum)
I've been sipping on like, vodka (Head's numb)
I'm blacking out, you better watch it (It's bedlam)"

Cold Wind Blows

[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro]
'Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
Some want a bigger stage
They came to see you spit your game, whoa
But it shouldn't be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again
You hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice you remain, fuck 'em all
Tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again

[Ad-Libs]
Oh!
God damn!
Is it that time again already?
Haha, okay
Y'all don’t look too happy to see me
Fuck, man
Don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right
Fuck y’all then!

[Verse 1]
You can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, dog—fall back, you mutts!
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it, a sick duck, I want my duck sicked, mummy
And my nuts licked, gobble 'em up, trick, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, dummy?
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance, while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah, struck a nerve, sucker
Motherfucker, might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cocksucker
The shit is on 'cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm shittin' and pissin' on everybody
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So puff the Buddha, light a bong, but take a look at Mariah
Next time I inspire you to write a song—come on!

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Motherfucker, I'll show you pussy-footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt 'til it makes a queef
And sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin'?
You musta mistook me for some sissy soft punk
Lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fuckin' hater, push me!
I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot 'cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up, sissy, G's up, all you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, ""Shady ease up!
Man, chill!"" Nah, I can't, goddamn it, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit, the day that happens the world will stop spinnin'
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a standstill
During an earthquake, urine in your face
'Cause you're fake (*lightning noise*)  Ow! What the fuck? That hurt, wait!
(*Lightning noise*) Ow! What the fuck? I just got struck by lightnin'
Alright then, I quit, God, I give up
Call it evil that men do
Lord, forgive me for what my pen do
""This is for your sins, I cleanse you
And you can repent, but I warn you
If you continue, to Hell I'll send you""
And just then the wind blew, and I said...

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 3]
How long will I be this way? Shady until my dyin' day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
""So long,"" 'til then, I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it, you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
""Oh, bitches don't like that,"" homie, I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man, I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
So, don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas, pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with Auto-Tune
The last thing you want to do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say, ""I was writing this and I thought of you,"" so

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Outro]
I don't know, I don't know what caused
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll probably be this way 'til my dyin' day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me"

Framed

[Verse 1]
Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's ""Freaky Tales"" (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she's decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said ""I'm here to do sink repairs.""
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there

[Chorus]
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Verse 2]
Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me
Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

[Chorus]
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Verse 3]
Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen
For [edited] eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement
Under your baby's play pen, I lay in, wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho: I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see ...

[Chorus]
I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed"

8 Mile

[Intro]
It's alright, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Gonna make it, can't give up now
I'ma make it somehow

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been 'vict'd
So I must then get off the bus, then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)

[Verse 2]
I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, ‘cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)

[Verse 3]
You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
‘Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)"

Drug Ballad

[Intro: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Yeah, hahahaha
Whoo, shit
Mmm
Oh, oh, mmm
Ehh, ehh
Aight, guess what? I ain't comin' in yet
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh
I'll come in a minute
Ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (Fuckin' faggot!)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no"" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, ""Yo, what the fuck we'd do?""
I gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do
‘Cause if I get caught cheatin', then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably
Gonna catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around lookin' like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more

[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no"" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysittin' for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed

[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no"" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)

These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

Drugs really got a hold of me
Really got a hold of me
These drugs really got a hold of me

Brain Damage

[Intro: Doctor & Nurse]
Scalpel
Here
Sponge
Here
Wait, he's convulsing, he's convulsing
Ahh
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God, oh my God
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God

[Verse 1]
These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in Junior High, this kid said
""It's you and I, three o'clock sharp, this afternoon you die""
I looked at my watch, it was 1:20
""I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me?""
He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse""
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Somethin' told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache, it works""
I screamed, ""Ow, my appendix feel like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick, I need a naked nurse""
""What's the matter?""
""I don't know, my leg, it hurts""
""Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy""
""Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee""
""Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework""
""But don't you wanna give me after school detention?""
""Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him""

[Chorus]
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

[Verse 2]
Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die, honky""
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(What's going on in here?)
I made 'em think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, drugs?!
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug"" (I'm sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look, bitch, what have you done?""
""Oh my God, I'm sorry, son""
Shut up, you cunt
I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

[Chorus]
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song

[Outro]
Brain damage, it's brain damage
I got brain damage, it's brain damage
It's probably brain damage, it's brain damage
Brain damage, I got brain damage"

Chloraseptic

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (Yeah)
To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go—hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & PHresher]
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah, uh (Haha), and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (Yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (Woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies' tails
Should write a children's storybook (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City, uh
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (Woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause…

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (bitch)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash (Bitch!)
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (Yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like—

[Chorus: PHresher]
—throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & PHresher]
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew"

My Darling

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yeah, look
If I were to rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
‘Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
Hear my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants, ‘cause I'm white and he's white
So he's like my competition, I mean, right?
Nope! Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba
So b-b-b-b-b-b, but I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin' giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em, and fill 'em
Full of poison, and make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
Tell him why, look him dead in the eye, then waste him
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk, one-two-three
Chk-chk, one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers: ""Come nearer!""

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Verse 2: Eminem]
""Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, come here!
Talk to me, sit! Here, pull up a chair!
Why don't you cut your hair?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dye it back, come on, try it!""
Ahh, no! I told you, leave me the fuck alone, will you?
""But I'm here to rebuild you,"" — but I already killed you!
""But Shady, we were meant for each other
Think about your mother,"" — yeah, so what of her?
""You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes,"" — fuck you, motherfucker!
I had you beat! — ""No, I was playin' possum
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
I'm taking it back,"" — you fuckin' bitch, why?!
""Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster? Ha-ha-ha-ha!""

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
""Shady, listen! (Shady!) You hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back!""
But I don't want it back — ""Yes, you do,"" — no, I don't
""Yes, you do! You're gonna regret it later,"" — no, I won't
""I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor""
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
""Well, I got him on the phone right now!""
(Slim!) You're lying! (Yo, Slim!) How, why now?
What up, Dre? (Check this out, Slim, I gotta talk to you
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs you became a lot softer)
But Dre, all Shady is, is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
(Well, just think about it, Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back and let me know what's up) — fuck this mirror!
""I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you
Let me guide you,"" — fuck you! Die, you son of a bitch!
""Put the gun down!"" — bye-bye! Boom!
Okay, I'm still alive, — ""So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha-ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal? Well, Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars: they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
Marshall…"" — What?! — ""No one's gonna love you like I do""
*Chainsaw starting up*

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
(I said) I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body (your body, your body, your body, your body)"

Bad Husband

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue-lashing, then you
Laughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn’t after we knew
That we were done and actually through (And actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different (Things different)
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I’m confused
Because—

[Chorus: X Ambassadors]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for Mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Givin' it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults they got… thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn’t mean
The words that we meant that we didn’t say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda led to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin’ still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself—

[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade & Eminem]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (You said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there’s always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
Sawing off a fuckin' body limb
Once upon a time we're all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit, we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard ""Mockingbird""
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
Shit, it's no wonder!

[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade, Eminem]
How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (You said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband"

Going Through Changes

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Lately, I really
Feel like I'm rollin' for delf like Philly
Feel like I'm losin' control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like
Is I'm complainin' but life keeps on complicatin', and
I'm debatin' on leavin' this world this evenin'
Even my girls can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dyin'? I am finally realizin' I need
Help, can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks, I've been havin' ups and downs
Goin' through peaks and valleys
Dilly-dallyin' 'round with the idea
Of endin' this shit right here, I'm hatin' my reflection
I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah
I look fat, but what do I care? I give a fuck
Only thing I fear's Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes
That I might see her... Shit

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah, Dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?
And you've fallen off with your skills and your own fans are laughin' at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle? Get up
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that, he wouldn't fuckin'
Shoot at nobody, he'd fight first, but dwellin'
On it only makes the night worse, now I'm poppin' Vics, Percs
And Methadone pills, ""Yeah, Em, tight verse
You killed it!"" Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gon' do whatever I says when I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then—

[Chorus: Eminem (& Ozzy Osbourne)]
(I'm going through changes) Don’t know what I’m gonna do
(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes

[Verse 3: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
My friends can't understand this new me, that's understandable
Man, but think how bananas you'd be, you'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do?
I'm startin' to live like a recluse
And the truth is, fame's startin' to give me an excuse
To be at an all-time low; I sit alone in my home theater
Watchin' the same damn DVD of the
First tour; the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurts so I fast forward, sleeping pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie, come on, dole 'em out!
""Daddy, don't you die on me! Daddy, better hold your ground!""
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice? Yeah, baby, hold me down (Daddy!)

[Chorus: Eminem, Hailie Jade (& Ozzy Osbourne)]
(I'm going through changes) (Daddy!) Don’t know what I’m gonna do
(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not've made it through?
I think about the things I would'a never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together, hey
Wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain, when it rains
Guess it pours — yes, it does, wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today I looked at your picture, almost if to say
I miss you subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say
I guess I'm—

[Chorus: Eminem (& Ozzy Osbourne)]
(I'm going through changes) Don’t know what I’m gonna do
(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes"

Cinderella Man

[Intro: Eminem & Kobe]
Yeah, you know, technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it
(Amen) Yeah! Ha-ha
(Amen) Feels good
(Amen) Woo!
(Amen) Guess I'm lucky
(Amen) Some of us don't get a second chance
(Amen) But I ain't blowin' this one
(Amen) Nah, man, ha-ha
(Amen) Shit, I feel like I can do anything now

[Verse 1: Eminem & Kobe]
Who can catch lightning in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on a fire hose, flyer than swatters?
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start to bug, prick, you better flee, 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin', no remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin'
For no one, knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up, stand behind you like, ""Woo!""
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly, he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you?

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem & Kobe]
Now guess who? (Hey) Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass (Hey), he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too (Hey)
Now (Hey) what's his name?

[Chorus: Kobe]
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man (Hey)
Cinderella, Cinderella Man (Hey)
Cinderella Man (Hey, hey)
If I had a time machine
I'd be Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Music is my time machine
So call me
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kobe]
Fuck catchin' lightning, he struck it, screamed, ""Shut up!"" at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Rewound the future to the present, paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past, motherfucker, he's the shit right now, he's
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella man, Cinderfella Shady Dane, came
To wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell, from Hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same old can't afford to be
A lame-o in this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly, so say bye
To the old, H-I to the new, que será
Consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grâce, raise 'em high
In the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient, I won't make no more mistakes, shit, my
Potato's baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin' weed—yeah, faggot, the stakes are high
Shit, I ain't even s'posed to be here by the grace of God
The skin on my teeth and a hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
And ain't shit you can do but fear it, Proof is here in spirit
And I'm his spittin' image, I mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I ""cunt"" hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists?

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem & Kobe]
Who? (Hey) Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass (Hey), he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too (Hey)
Now (Hey) what's his name?

[Chorus: Kobe]
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man (Hey)
Cinderella, Cinderella Man (Hey)
Cinderella Man (Hey, hey)
If I had a time machine
I'd be
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Music is my time machine
So call me
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man"

We Made You

[Intro: Eminem]
Guess who? D'you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby) (Yeah)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
""Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!""
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Bridge: Eminem]
And that's why, my love
You'll never live without
I know you want me, girl
'Cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know
You know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby
I'm the only one for you (*fart*)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
""Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!""
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Outro: Eminem]
So baby
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Oh Amy! Rehab never looked so good!
I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha-ha, woo!
Dr. Dre! 2020!
Yeah!"

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9""]
Bumstickitty, bumstickitty, bum huh
I got that old rum-pum-pum-pum
A punk'll jump up to get him a beat down
At least sound, I sound like these clowns, like he sound
My flow all over the place, four-four in the waist, I'm so, so innovative
Po-po in the way, I'll roll over 'em and make bacon
And call 'em a pig, won't you hop up off of my dick?
Words in the way, I'm at loss by him
I give you a JFK on the front lawn of MLK in the crossfire (Get down, nigga)
I have evolved into the lost diaries of the mob and the Rothschilds (C'mon)
I feel like God broke the vials and I am just layin' down inside 'em like caulk and tile (Q-Tip)

[Chorus: Q-Tip, Royce da 5'9"" & dEnAun]
Man, here we go
I said that we live in the land of criminal
My era, my era, my era so original
Uh-huh, I survived it and that's a miracle, ah, man
'Cause I'm from Slaughterhouse (People), check yourself
Like Ice Cube said, ""Before you wreck yourself"" (Bitches)
Like Wu-Tang said, ""You should protect yourself"" (Animals)
I got 'em goin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Get down, nigga)
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yo, snappin' necks plus I'm live, in effect
I'm in the Slick Rick eye patch, but I got it from Hex
Rappers avoid eye contact, that's outta respect
For the god in the flesh, the ominous Indominus Rex
They be like, ""You put the Thought on? Yikes""
If I told y'all once, I told y'all twice, that motherfucker is nice
I'm the king of the blood sport on mics
I'm from an era you had beef, y'all prolly fist fought on sight
Get your ass beat at the basketball court on spite
Then tell your wife to put your life support on ice
I'm the rap Pernell Whitaker, the honorable minister
Leavin' every amateur inoperable, I finished 'em
Makin' plaques outta they head like dead venison
Used to be the bad lieutenant with M-Illitant
Spillin' over fabulous jams my man Dilla sent
Rap speak for me, I am the ventriloquist
I'm so stubborn, the government won't govern
That brother you spoke of, it just wasn't as dope, was it?
I'm cold buzzin', I never been low budget
The taste of your own medicine, here come a dose of it
I break free like Chesimard
Keep 'em guessin' hard while broads say my bars is like ASMR
All my dogs is out the reservoir
Top five, I'm where the legends are (Keep goin')
Live at the edge of darkness and light
One phone call, my youngins takin' flight
You a bark bitch, and never bite, long kiss goodnight
I stay heated, my people in the place need it
If you ain't standin' up for yourself, then stay seated
And they cheated, they lie like Amerigo Vespucci
I'm a miracle, I'm still super lyrical
Live from the Terrordome, loud like a megaphone
Thutmose the Third with seven inch herringbones

[Chorus: Q-Tip, Royce da 5'9"" & dEnAun]
Man, here we go
I said that we live in the land of criminal
My era, my era, my era so original
Uh-huh, I survived it and that's a miracle, ah, man
'Cause I'm from Slaughterhouse (People), check yourself
Like Ice Cube said, ""Before you wreck yourself"" (Bitches)
Like Wu-Tang said, ""You should protect yourself"" (Animals)
I got 'em goin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Get down, nigga)
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Better hope an ambulance is en route
Papers are hand grenades soon as I pull the pin out
I am the Santa Fe, Mandalay and Orlando and Colorado and Columbine
All combined into one, I don't walk a line, bitch, I run
'Cause we don't got no time to waste, so come on Denaun
Here come me, 5-to-9 and Thought, da-dun, da-dun
Then like a shotgun I'm ready to cock it on 'em
Leave these pussies stretched out like the Octomom
Never had no trouble keepin' up with the times
I just adapt to the climate, I treat it like my Levi's
When they ain't buttoned up right, I adjust on the fly
Middle fingers, put 'em high, that's why they call it a bird
'Cause you put it up in the sky
And I'm like a spider crawlin' up your spinal column
I'm climbin' all up the sides of the asylum wall
And dive in a pile of Tylenol, you're like a vagina problem
To a diabolical gynecologist tryna ball a fist, I will
Fuck you, just buy me, double timing the rhyming
I leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like Bill O'Reilly
I'ma show you what I mean when they call me the Harvey Weinstein of 2019
I'm a conniving, when I'm on the mic I'ma standout
Like a lime green wife beater with a knife out
I'm a sight to see, but you can see from the ring I'm wearing
Me and this game, we got married already
Had the prenup ready, fucked on her, should've seen her belly
She barely was three months pregnant
Bitch had it, gave me a baby, we named it Machine Gun Kelly
Now here's to LL, Big L and Del
K-Solo, Treach, and G Rap
DJ Polo, Tony D, ODB, Moe Dee, Run-DMC
Ed O.G. , and EPMD, D.O.C., Ice-T, Evil Dee
King Tee, UTFO, and Schoolly D, PE, and BDP
YZ and Chi-Ali, Rakim and Eric B., they were like my therapy
From B.I.G. and Paris, Three Times Dope, and some we'll never see, and PRT
N.W.A and Eazy-E, and D-R-E was like my GPS
Without him, I don't know where I'd be

[Chorus: Q-Tip, Royce da 5'9"" & dEnAun]
Man, here we go
I said that we live in the land of criminal
My era, my era, my era so original
Uh-huh, I survived it and that's a miracle, ah, man
'Cause I'm from Slaughterhouse (People), check yourself
Like Ice Cube said, ""Before you wreck yourself"" (Bitches)

Still Shady

[Verse]
I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog
Night club, shit, I was taught
If your CD's on fire you had to put it out yourself like Highland Park
No fire department, so you might not hear sirens at all
But don't be alarmed if I sound off
Something just ain't right with me, dog
A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder?
Widely regarded highly? Bite me, sweetheart
I'm slightly retarded, but tonight I'm startin'
Shit, I'm feeling self righteous and might just hop in a mosh pit
On some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Lookin' to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of The LOX, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock
Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet
Panic attack 'cause I'm claustrophobic
No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver for movement
'Cause I have no room for improvement
I'm practically squashed, compacted and boxed in
Toxic, cans of arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content
Bar exam, start of insanity
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
Animal snarls, cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter
Looking skantless as Hannibal's stalking
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
(Whistle) Black out, Zach Galifianakis
Gallons of Vodka, but that gal has some knockers
I bet'cha they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious
What happened, doc? I passed out again
Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
Stolen Magnavox and bag of rocks in back of a Datsun
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the StairMaster
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
No underwear, grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
Air Maxes in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich
And the cross stitching is a cross mixing
Of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin
Fin, cotton Dockers, OshKoshes, drop crotches
Swatch watches and sneakers match with the parkas
But it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
With all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers
And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious
Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?
Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall
I’ll stand there and yell that at a wall
'Til the mannequin dolls scatter and the inanimate objects
That I'm battering all shatter and fall
'Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped
I'm a spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables
Hooked up to my fucking back, I'm a Duracell
But I sure as hell got it backwards 'cause y'all get jumped
And I'll catch the battery charge, but
I got a hunch like your back when it's arching
When I start attacking your squadron
You'll feel like MasterCard when I'm charging
So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you
Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers
So get the sack like Wisconsin
That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Don't get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all
I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
Affable guy next door's laughable
My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion, hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
I got a Magic Johnson
It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
I laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malignaggi, she Slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am a misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
Just so happens she's fond of algae
'Cause now she faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half of you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
Five-finger discount
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
Kidnapping your mom 'cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery
Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey, and Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit
(""Em"") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse, get on some bullshit
Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson
Macklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth
And have some back and forths
And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's ""Control"" verse
And perform ""Fack"" in concert [""Fack"" plays]
Yo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album
Now that was awesome
It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like (I'll stick around)
And put up with my crap so long for, what's the attraction, mama?
Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
Who knows at this point, it's always poking so na-ah
Still get along with this voice 'cause that's the ""Monster""
So do-si-do with the (na-ah) sociopath
Everyone who knows me knows that
What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio
(Na-ah) She loves the way I lie
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole
That my disguise is pants, but they on fire
So am I-a, (Wu) Cappadonna, cut the track off
Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking
I'm wrapping up all the presents
In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowing a head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back all the bath salt packets are gone, I
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar, splash of Bizarre, Thrasher, and Aerosmith
And I'm a spectacular archer, feed Count Dracula Chocula
Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan, bandwagoners
I'm kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em
Smack Kim Basinger on her ass in the sauna"

Rock Bottom

[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
Ayo, this song is dedicated
To all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

[Verse 2]
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

[Verse 3]
There's people that love me and people that hate me (Yup)
But it's the evil that made me
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm)
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom"

Castle

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we’re alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you’ll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1995, dear Hailie
This is your song

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You'll be coming out of Mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
That's all that matters for the time being
But obviously assuming you will be
Just thinking ahead, I’ma make it if it kills me
Let’s see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion (ha!)
Sorry for sloppy writing
The pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me
Dad’s a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write them
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As I'm using in this letter, maybe they can feel me as I'm
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to Mom and Dad’s crazy world
Love, Daddy, maple-flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1996, dear Hailie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
But you'll grow into them, baby, I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
I just keep steering, I'ma turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'ma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about Dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping that you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 24th, 2007, dear Hailie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang
I never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One-hundred percent finished
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote
As a goodbye note, but your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go
I'm getting sleepy, love, Dad… shit, I don't know

[The sound of a bottle of pills being opened is heard. Eminem ingests them and collapses over the floor]"

Soldier

[Intro]
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier (la-de-dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo...

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 2]
I love pissin' you off, gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2""
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a—

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 3]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a—

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

Yo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left

Like Home

[Intro]
Yeah, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? He's tryin' to divide us
This shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can’t from our stars and stripes 'cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner""
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we all

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Bridge: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go (Yeah)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home"

No Regrets

[Intro: Eminem & Don Toliver]
(Oh, oh, yeah) Yeah
You know, if I had a chance to do it all over again (Oh, oh)
I wouldn't change shit (Oh, oh)
D.A. got that dope
I'm screamin' out no regrets

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low, the 'Vette look like a storm (Screamin' out no regrets)
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm—

[Verse 1: Eminem & Don Toliver]
Yeah, they miss the old me
I think they want me to OD on codeine
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and I'm hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing
I had to go see the doc like Kool Moe Dee (Yeah)
Never took much to convince Dre
Never been swayed by color or skin shades
Since day one, Hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
Givin' up, no comprende (Woo)
Tin brain, prolly fucked in the membrane
Slim Sha— mind's in the gutter, but insane
Pen game like I just struck in the tenth frame (Screamin' out no regrets)
Yeah, I live on the edge, I sit on the ledge
To shit on your heads, I been on the bench
Forgive and forget is the only thing I'd ever live to regret
Hell-bent on revenge, you left me for dead
I crawled out my grave, you better be ready and set
My enemies ain't put an end to me yet (I'm screamin' out no regrets)

[Chorus: Don Toliver & Eminem]
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low, the 'Vette look like a storm (Screamin' out no regrets, yeah, no apologies, I ain't takin' shit back)
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so (Yeah) lost

[Verse 2: Eminem]
All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from
But it's happening again, huh?
Y'all used to be in my corner
Now you just backed me in one
Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some
For some adversaries, I carry big guns
So some targets'll get the kill shot
Some, I just barely nicked 'em
I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
For sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit
Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt (Yeah)
Shoulda never made a response, shoulda just aimed for the fake ones
Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts
They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once (Yeah)
And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
And can't listen to ""Arose"" without cryin'
For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
But this is only for those that I'm inspirin'
Weapon never unholstered without firin'
My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion
They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle (Handle)
'Cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars
But sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards
Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
Or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an anthill
(I'm screamin' out no regrets) Can't do it, nah

[Chorus: Don Toliver & Eminem]
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets, took it all)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low, the 'Vette look like a storm (Screamin' out no regrets, yeah, no regrets though, no white flags either)
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets, yeah)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm—"

8 Mile: Lotto vs B-Rabbit

[Lotto (Nashawn 'Ox' Breedlove)]
Yo, I'll spit a racial slur, honky, sue me
The shit is a horror flick, but the black guy doesn't die in this movie
Fuckin' with Lotto? Dawg, you gotta be kiddin'
That makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin'
You think these niggas gon' feel the shit you say?
I got a better chance joinin' the KKK
On some real shit though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck ""Lotto,"" call me your leader
I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from 'Leave It To Beaver'
I used to like that show, now you got me in fight-back mode
But oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go
I hate to do this, I would love for this shit to last
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And all's well that ends okay
So I'll end this shit with a ""Fuck you"", but ""Have a nice day!""

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver
So was Eddie Haskell, Wally, and Ms Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid
Quick, someone get his ass another steroid!
""Blah-badi-boo-blah, bah-badi-bloo-blah!""
I ain't hear a word you said: ""Hippity hoopla!""
Is that a tank-top or a new bra?
Look! Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boobjob
Didn't you listen to the last round, meathead?
Pay attention, you're sayin' the same shit that he said
Matter of fact, dawg, here's a pencil
Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful
And don't come back until somethin' dope hits you
Fuck it, you can take the mic home with you
Lookin' like a cyclone hit you
Tank-top screamin', ""Lotto, I don't fit you!""
You see how far the white jokes get you
Boys like, ""How Vanilla Ice gon' diss you?""
My motto: ""Fuck Lotto!""
I get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow"

Who Knew

[Intro]
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd)
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Mic check, one-two
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Who woulda knew?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Who woulda known?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Fuck woulda thought?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(I never knew I'd)

[Verse 1]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music (No)
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face — what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth
How? Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn them around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics
While our President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music
This is for your kid's amusement (the kids!)
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 2]
So who's bringin' the guns in this country? (Hm?)
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun
Through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with an Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screaming, ""Go!"" with their seventeen-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?!
Ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up
You allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear? (Hm?)
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
(Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And ""fuck"" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch
And changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 3]
I never knew I, knew I'd have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck! Shit! Ass! Bitch! Cunt! Shooby-de-doo-wop! (Oops)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis, horses and hittin' some trees (Hey)
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a tea-
-cher? Her? Him? Is it you? Is it them?
""Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!""
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

Nowhere Fast

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world’s on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we’re never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin’ me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I’m simply stating a fact
I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff, blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn’t scaring us, we pass
Nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just—

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin’ in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a… no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin', we have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch—war machine
But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
'Til the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just—

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're…)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a… no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

[Bridge: Eminem & Kehlani]
You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh oh
(We're on the run of our lives)
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is—

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're…)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah)
(We don't give a… no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast"

8 Mile: Lyckety-Splyt vs B-Rabbit

[Lyckety Splyt (Strike)]
This guy's a choke artist, you'll catch a bad one
You're better off shooting yourself with Papa Doc's handgun
Climbing up this mountain, you're weak
I'll leave you lost without a paddle, floating shit's creek
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D, you're the new kid on the block
'Bout to get smacked back to the boondocks
Fucking Nazi, your squad ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music
Trailer trash, I'll choke you to your last breath
And have you looking foolish like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
'Cause you follow Future like he got carrots up his ass crack
And when you acting up that's when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up
I'll crack your shoulder blade
You'll get dropped so hard that Elvis will start turning in his grave
I don't know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 Mile to the trailer park

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Erick Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
It's all dudes in here, except for these bitches
So I'm a German, eh?
That's okay, you look like a fuckin' worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can six dicks be pussies
Talkin' 'bout shit's creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek with paddles this deep
You're still gonna sink, you're a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit, this is a turtle race
He can't get with me, spitting this shit wickedly
Lickety shot suspicious spickety split lickety
So I'ma turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile"

Baby

[Verse 1]
One thousand different houses and Münchausen, I'ma make you
Wanna punch out some-fuckin'-one: ""Ouch! What the fuck you hit me for?!""
Screamed life as I punch counter, in bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown
Black hoodie with a scythe, shit, I laughed in his face, spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like, ""Take this!
Now get your ass back in that game, bitch! Don't take shit
For granted, and don't take shit, give it!""
Only bull you should take is by the horns, a mixture of Whitey Ford
And Mighty Thor, I everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writin', then record, replenish, keep writin' more
Nothing's ridin' on it but your pride, that's all you're fightin' for
So you fight, scratch, you claw, backs to wall, no one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls like they're gargantuan and ask yourself how fuckin' bad you want it
Pull out your badge for whoopin' ass and flash it on 'em
Nobody's gonna back you in the corner, you're a hornet
No one's more ignorant than you fuckin' four in the mornin'
You're at the laboratory, stormin' like there's nothin' that's more important
Emcees, you better consider this a formal warnin', you're in for it!
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?
I ain't finished, bitch, I meant ""in half"", oil the blades
Nobody wants to play, they say I'm a spoiled lil' baby, but—

[Chorus]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

[Verse 2]
What goes through an addict's brain besides static pain
And Big Daddy Kane, breakbeats and words? An erratic train
Of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain
Yeah, maybe that explains why you're back but don't rap the same (Yeah!)
And you're lookin' way thinner 'cause your hunger got you lookin' like
They took away dinner (Chicka) ""Sugar Ray"" Leonard
Wouldn't sugar-coat a fuckin' booger though just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a (Chicka) what? (Chicka) GOAT
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips, hope it lands on
Another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit anything of wit
That's interesting to spit, yo, who's king of this fuckin' English lit?
Let your middle fingers flip on each hand while extendin' the shit
How low can you go? Lower than Chuck D, ho
Hear the bassiness in my voice? Rocky's back, where my Adrian's?
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots
To rap; I'm not a man, I'm a weapon who just happened
To be a rapper who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom
I'd never be the same after now I'm back with an appe-
-tite for destruction and a fuckin' recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished, every deed is a dastardly
One, evilest bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-
-lite to people's like me havin' my teeth pulled

[Chorus]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

[Verse 3]
So step inside a dimension demented side of a mind that's like
An inside of an engine while I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded: if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper you'll be the first one who finds him offensive
Got him climbin' the fences, lost some time to addiction
But look up ""rhyme"" in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture
""Eminem"" is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma
Fuck it, let's get to the meatballs, I'm gonna skip the
Veg and potatoes, edumacator (They are)
Shit, legends are made of, spit treacherous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretched is what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman with metham-
-phetamines in each left hand, in each right is a sledgehammer
In pajamas, standin' in front of a webcam
Beatin' themselves in the head 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam
Maybe I need my head exam-ed, Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hangin' from his ceiling, drippin' with a bed pan
I need meds, swear to God 'cause if I go off the edge
T.I. ain't talkin' me off the ledge, man
Heart-throb that'll fart, ah, nah
More like a smart slob, part blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-
-ject to the heart and leave claw marks all over the Wal-
-Mart walls, little baby with large balls
Fuck mud-slingin', I'm blood-flingin'
There's nothing on this fuckin' Earth better than bein' the
King of the playground, I hate the swings, but I love bein'
An underdog 'cause when I'm pushed I end up swingin' (Ah!)

[Chorus]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya"

Square Dance

[Produced by Eminem & Jeff Bass]

[Intro: Eminem]
People, it feels so good to be back!
Ladies and gentleman
Introducing the new and improved you-know-who

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash, all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief, and let me just keep shit simple
Can-I-Bitch don't want no beef with Slim, no!
Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off?
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From séance to séance, aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw

[Chorus: Eminem]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah, let your hair down to the track, yeah, kick on back (Boo!)
The boogie monster of rap, yeah, the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin'
You might not like, this white hot light
That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there!
Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there (Haha!)
Yeah, you laugh 'til your mothafuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band-camp thinkin' that crap can't happen
'Til you fuck around, get an Anthrax napkin
Inside a package, wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back, gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins hijackin' Amtraks, crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby gettin' recruited at 18
You're on a plane now, eatin' their food and their baked beans
I'm 28, they gon' take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say ""Hussein,"" you say ""Shady""
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

[Chorus: Eminem]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me—stab me, shoot at me! (Woo-hoo!)
Psychotic, hypnotic product, I got the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada-yada
God, I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la
Oochie-walla-walla, um-da-dah-da-dah-da, but you gotta-gotta
Keep movin', there's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock and Hennessy, thug like I'm 'Pac, on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah, buddy, laugh! It's funny: I have the money
To have you killed by somebody who has nothin'
I'm past bluffin', pass the K-Y
Let's get ready for some intense serious ass-fucking!

[Chorus: Eminem]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Dr. Dre wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas wants to square dance with me
X to the Z wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes wants to square dance with me
Can-i-bitch won't square dance with me
Fan-a-bitch won't square dance with me
Canada-bis don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen wants to square dance with you
Yeeehawww! Wee!"

Insane

[Produced by Dr. Dre]

[Verse 1]
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah, fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
""We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed""
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
""After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest,"" the next day my mother said
""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead!""
""Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I'll bet you he's fakin' it, I'll bet you, I bet
He probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this, of course, unless you object?""
""Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head!""

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!

[Verse 2]
""Did you get him?"" Nah, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding-dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady, dawg
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dawg?
Shady, dawg, what be goin' through that fuckin' brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for? Sing along!

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!

[Verse 3]
Don't you know what felch means? (""Yeah"") Well then, tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching (Urrp!)
Burp, belch, and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying, man? Can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me (Oh...)
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
""Shady, what the fuck you saying?"" — I don't know, help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fuckin' melting!
""Marshall, I just love you, boy, I care about your well-being""
No, Dad, I said no! — I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it ""Pubic Hair on Chelsea""
""Well, this is called 'Ass Rape' and we're shooting the jail scene!""

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane"

Still Don’t Give a Fuck

[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the Devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' the limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with this
Livin' amuck, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 2]
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you 'til you dangle, and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match (""Here, Momma, try 'em on"")
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 3]
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now, how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck, I was born durin' an earthquake

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass"

My Dad’s Gone Crazy

*Television static*
*Eminem begins to snort cocaine*

[Speech: Steve King & Hailie Jade]
Hello, boys and girls! Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships. Do you have a daddy? I'll bet you do!
*Hailie opens the door*
*Eminem snorts cocaine*
Who's your daddy?
Daddy, what are you doing?

[Intro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
Ha-ha!
Okay then! Everybody, listen up!
I'm goin' to hell! Who's comin' with me?
Somebody, please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy!

[Verse 1: Eminem, Hailie Jade & Dr. Dre]
There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high, no plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
(Rahhnnn!) Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
(Suck it, Marshall!) So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one of these Russians, and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
(*Knocking*) Hailie, tell 'em, baby! (My dad's lost it!)

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
It's like my mother always told me:
""Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and
Goddamn it, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!""
Uh… Fuck that shit, bitch!
Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick
And lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch
Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose, than quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meenee-meini-mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore? (Dad!)

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, see, what you're seein'
Is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first, ‘cause when I speak
It's tongue-in-cheek, I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade
Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky
'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Outro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
Crazy
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha
You're funny, Daddy!"

Déjà Vu

[Intro: Matthew St. Patrick]
DMC, we have a mid-thirties male found down, unresponsive
Possible overdose, substance unknown
Pulse is 60 and thready
Respiration is eight
He's intubated and we're bagging him now
Uh, BP 90 over palp
Patient is cool, pale, and diaphoretic
Has aspirated, uh, GSC is 3
Will update en route, ETA: ten minutes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene
To receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil, like, ""I think I'll just have a taste""
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium
Like, ""yeah, that's great""
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
""Mommy, something is wrong with Dad I think
He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating 3 Musketeers in the rear seat""

[Chorus: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
""Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?""
That's the devil in my ear, I've been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me, he's all I can fucking hear
""Marshall, come on, we'll watch the game
It's the Cowboys and Buccaneers""
""And maybe if I just drink half
I'll be half-buzzed for half of the time""
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale, man, I got half a mind
To have another half a glass of wine
Sounds asinine, yeah, I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch, I'm 'bout to fall
I miss the couch and down I go, lookin' like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?
Man, fuck, am I hungover, and goddamn, I got a headache
Shit, half a Vicodin, why can't I?
All systems ready for take off, please stand by

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then (Ahhh!)
Couple of weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse; you lose Proof, so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve-noon, ain't no harm in self-inducin' a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse
""Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax""
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Okay, so now ya see the reason how come he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas, you know the whole pneumonia thing?
It was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it? So you can lie to Hailie
I'm going beddy-bye, Whitney, baby; good night, Alaina!
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn

[Chorus: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know"

[Verse 1]
You're walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the mornin' and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible, right there's the coroner
Waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run
All you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit, while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a Klonopin while I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it 'round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must've just blacked out again—not again!

[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Verse 2]
Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana then
I reach for the aloe and lanolin, bust all over the wall panellin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantel and
Grab my flannel and my bandana, then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again, brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors, and pins
Jesus, when does it end? Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do?
Hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them

[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Bridge]
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

[Verse 3]
I cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half-pint of the Jack, my last Vic and-a-half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub, cut him up into pieces
And just when I went to drink his blood
I thought, ""I oughta drink his bathwater, that oughta be fun""
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son
Your blood-curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's got to be one
Oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up, 'cause…

[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Outro]
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil… rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil… rise)

Alfred’s Theme

[Verse 1]
Before I check the mic (Check, check, one, two)
I give it a extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe (Good evening)
Coronavirus in effect tonight
Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (Yeah)
I throw on my tux, then I (Yeah) give zero fucks, then I (Yeah)
Act like a jockstrap (Uh), cup my nuts, then I (Yeah)
Check my ball hair (What?), make sure it's all there (Yeah)
Then call the pallbearer (Yeah)
It's Music to Bе Murdered By again, why stop?
Overkill likе a pipe bomb in your pine box
You're all hitched to my cock (What?)
Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
Then treated it like a cyclops
Like it's the only one I (Only one eye) got
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (Chk-chk)
Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
That's why there's parental advising (Visine) every time I drop (Eye drop)
So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal
But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?
Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
The filthiest, so all this talk about I'm washed up, how preposterous
Because if cleanliness is next to godliness
It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself
And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
Still on top the pile
Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
Quick to call you out on your bullshit
Don't make me give that crock a dial
'Cause if I do it, see you later, alligator
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the
Bars that never slack (Yeah), but always get attacked (Yeah)
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'Cause I have this target on my back (Ew, yuck)
But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans
I'd probably pop five Xans (Yeah)
Go in my garage, start my van
Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can
And doze off like *snores*
But odds like that, with these thoughts I have's like a giant getting squashed by ants
If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors
Like I just tossed my crayons (Tossed my crayons)
Small, medium, and large size cans
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and
If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands

[Interlude]
Shit, hold on, man
Motherfucker
Happy birthday to—
Fuck (Shh, quiet)

[Verse 2]
I sit in silence in candlelit environments
Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent
Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this
But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes
Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this
I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch

[Interlude]
What the fuck? Hold on, wait
""I'm Diddy's side bitch?""
Oh, I'm still east side, bitch

[Verse 3]
So 'til the E-N-D, since EPMD
Been givin' y'all the business (Yeah), D-R-E and me (Yup)
From the MMLP to (Huh?) MTBMB (Bitch)
Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (Haha)
So call me Santa Claus (Santa Claus)
'Cause at the present (Yeah), I out-rap 'em all (Wrap 'em all), I'm at the mall
Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (Uh)
Through a plastic straw (Yeah) with a fractured jaw (Damn)
My dick is coat check (Ha), she wanna jack it off (Yeah)
I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law
Mentally, I'm fucked up generally (General Lee) (Duh)
Dukes of Hazzard car (Yeah), get the cadaver dogs
'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked
This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (Brr)
This chicken hit my phone, she said, ""Chirp, chirp""
I said, ""Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt""
Then go eat some worms, like the early bird
What the fuck is love? That's a dirty word
Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth
Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt
And I won't buy her designer, 'cause I don't pander (Panda)
But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (Damn)
And this the final chapter (Why?), 'cause I'm either frying after (Oh)
Or they gon' give me the needle (What?) like a vinyl scratcher (DJ)
Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark
At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art
And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't
No bite, like a tree, mostly just all bark, arf, arf
But y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking (Bar king, bark, bark, barking)
And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park
I'd describe it as bowling (Why?) ball hard (Ball's hard)
'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when
It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten
'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again
And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens (Pins)
The cypher begins
I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe
It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin
My mind is a recycling bin
There's no place I never been
But I never budge and I never bend
You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends
Like adult diapers for men
Even when I'm rappin' less stellar
It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller (Cellar)
Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth
And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route
So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you
But if bars were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter
'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (Nah)
So you'd be a fitted (Yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap
Bitch, I'll pee (P) on your head like a Phillies hat (Haha)
No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree
Bitch, you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree
You never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea
You're always punkin' out like Halloween
You rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk
Homie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump
And you're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump
Bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk
Yeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to
Disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah
This is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome
'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album
So I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer
The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt
I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood
It's lookin' like it's that time of the month
Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt
I'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but
Y'all will get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos
I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable
Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome
Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo
Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope
You out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole

[Outro]
Wait, why'd the beat cut off?
Fuck it"

Crack a Bottle

[Intro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
Okay, let's go!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Break 1: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Break 2: Eminem]
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move,"" a bitch move

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk"

Lock It Up

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, like that
Okay, yeah

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak & Eminem]
Say, bro, (Yeah) where you get them from?
Detroit? (Yeah) That machine gun, spray boy
And it's gon' hit some
New coupe? (Ooh) Been whippin' 'em
New boobs? (Yeah) Where you get them done?
Payroll (Nice), might put you on a table
And spread you out like some Yayo (I'm naughty, yah)
No, bitch (Oh), you don't know shit (No)
You just want all my money, ah
I was hopeless (Oh), now I'm focused (No)
Where the fuck is the party at?
Now hold this (Oh), oh shit (Oh)
That's it (Yeah), so sick (Oh)
No shit (Oh)
Damn, I'm (Yeah) getting too fuckin' old for this (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
But still as explosive with, just load the clip
Two pistols on hip, both are gripped
I hold them at shoulder width
Took a stab in the dark and broke the tip
Of my knife off, but your throat is slit
'Cause I'm cutthroat to the utmost with it
The ultimate
I just let the poker chips fall where they were supposed to fit
Now those days are over, scrapin' change in sofas
Tryna save at Kroger (Yeah)
So why would I give a fuck about backstabbin' Trader Joe for?
How 'bout that, I'm paid as Oprah
Think I may have broke the scale
'Cause the wait is over
But wait, wait, hold up, 'cause they say I almost

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I almost lost it
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
You almost got me (Stop it, stop it)
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
You almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), but I got it (I got it)
You almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), I got it (I got it)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So sit there and act pathetic and sulk
'Cause I'm getting green, Incredible Hulk
'Cause I usually get it in bulk
But I still will stomp your head to a pulp (Yeah)
You want smoke, I got the tical like Method Man
So get ready to die from second hand
Get a whiff of the doctor's medicine
Like sedatives you'll get popped, Excedrin
'Cause you can get it like over the counter (Yo)
Like I just left the damn concession stand (Yeah)
A mic in my hand's a weapon (What?)
I put that on everything like ranch, I'll never land
I'm too fly, I don't plan to ever Cinderella Man
What I am is better than
Every single one of you
Whether separate or all of you band together
And I put the game on the pill (Yeah)
Now my Shady babies are all stillborns
Meaning abortions that live 'cause they were still born
I can heal 'em with Neosporin
You 'bout to experience euphoria
(I'm a) true warrior, got the plug like Trugoy
Give me the cue like I'm ScHoolboy
And I'll treat the beat like a pitbull would do to a chew toy and destroy it, 'cause, boy, I

I almost lost it
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
You almost got me (Stop it, stop it)

Groundhog Day

[Intro]
""What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare.""

[Verse 1]
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'Til one day I grew suspicious
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start anew, but ditchin'
Missouri for Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone, put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitchin’, her rules are Krypton-ite
So the walls, I done lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, runnin' through the kitchen
Pretendin' to be blind Superman, 'cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into Invisible Kid
Disappear out of sight like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different
Music into the picture, and it became my new religion

[Interlude]
""I remember it clearly, even today.""

[Verse 2]
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan
Always itchin' for somethin' to do, was flippin'
Through the radio stations one day
And discovered this DJ who was mixin'
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to The Wizard
You ain't have a fuckin' clue what you was missin'
I'd zone out with my headphones
All I remember doing's wishin' for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas, bitch!
It's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J coolin' system
Made that final manoeuvre to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this
That's how I knew my mission
Little boom box boomin', spittin'
Practicin' numerous writtens
When I'd sit in my room, envisionin' my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go cuckoo ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed
To do this shit; never quit, too persistent

[Interlude]
""Carved an underground empire.""

[Verse 3]
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all band together, there ain't no stoppin' this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin'
You, and you forgot your written
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knockin' again
It tried ding-dong ditchin' shit, I fuckin' got that bitch in
A headlock, cut off its oxygen, Slim
Is not budgin' like cocksuckin' cinder blocks in the wind
Now I got a pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, koppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin', leg up on the competition
Promisin' complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em
Stompin' 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle, bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words
Is loose, but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts – shit, no wonder you're sore losers!
Now where's your poo, birds?
Ooh, no more trippin' in bird shit
Songs of self-empowerment surgin'
Words of encouragement, but discouragin'
The rappers, the rap game's god
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
Since yours ain't workin' out, each verse is
More merciless than the first is
And you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch
To get served, bloodthirst revenge of the nerds, chka

[Interlude]
""That you'll not escape my vengeance.""

[Verse 4]
But the dumpy kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turnin' into a non-humble Don
You blonde dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched
Show you I'm bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo
On the fuckin' Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaats
I'll leave you stretched out like a fuckin' yawn
So mow the fuckin' lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fuckin' up this whole landscape of rap
The G.O.A.T. just ate eight acres, an eighth of that
Was just to make a path
And take it straight to your favorite rapper
Oh, look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
Charred debris floatin' like Oakwood
Was burnin', return of the no good and I won't quit

[Interlude]
""And the next thing I know
Something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a blamed...""

[Hook]
And I don't quit, won't change
It's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may
See if I popped your head

[Bridge]
I'm a monster, mutt
I'ma turn into a monster
I'm a monster, mutt
With my dick in your mouth all day!

[Outro]
""I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing."""

Eminem Freestyles on Tim Westwood | 2009

[Intro: Eminem, Mr. Porter & Tim Westwood]
Yo blast me off, Tim
Where's that boom?
Blast me off, son
The bombs, man!
Right now, we're doin' this for Beijing, baby, you understand how it's goin' down
That's how he talk
Blastin' off right now, son
Real big
Real legendary up in the game
Yeah
Drippin' in swagger juice
Yeah
We ready to go in this?
Yeah, yeah

[*Plays ""Respect My Conglomerate"" by Busta Rhymes*]

Are we swaggered up?
Swaggered up, yeah, check somebody's swag
Let's do it, baby, Radio 1, Westwood, sample's about to go down
Check my swag Eminem
Kon, babyAlchemist
We're doin' it like this. Let's go, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A'ight, a'ight, look

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wasn't born mean, I was pushed to treachery
I walk the streets lookin' for some puss to fetch me
I'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't gimme Kim, things could get messy
So pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
And press against the right one 'til it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods, the MC
With the Christopher Reeves beef, we started off on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg made outta wood?
I shouldn't, yes, I should
Ridin' through the hood, I'm chillin' with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like Jell-O
I'm like, ""Hello,"" to a cute little dyke on the mic
I'm kinda like Iron Mike 'cause I bite earlobes

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter & Eminem]
Yeah, well, I must must say
Well, um (Yeah), I'm just not gay
Well, um, I must must say
Wm, well, look- (Mr Porter, son)
See I'm the first one to class and the last to leave
I mean the first one to leave outta class, believe
That I'm a mailbox pimp in my heart 'til I die
Even after I'm all gone and my ashes fried
Went from an ashy guy, class clown as high
To a grown-ass man stackin' motherfuckin' paper
Runyon Ave.'s the clique, D12's the game
We've been spittin' this shit since we was little bébés
Gaga goo goo, nana, nani do do, never
Word to my homie Em, I'm just too too clever
A 4-5 shot'll leave a nigga's face lop-sided
The kick from the barrel make you think I'm cock-eyed
When I bust it off in the crowd, niggas start divin'
Greg Louganis went over the bar, I ain't lyin'
Hot iron lethals, not defyin' a soldier
Runyon Ave. soldier equals death when it's over
It's none colder than niggas that understand the struggle
Apply the street-muscle, we've been had to hustle
We've been had to hustle, we've been had to muscle
Apply the street hustle, we've been had to hustle

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, aight
Me and Westwood blastin' off, jackin' off
In a pair of acid washed bumpin' Asher Roth
Cruisin Gratiot 'til I damn near crashed the car
I'm tryna smash 'em off in the dash, hit the overpass, went off
Over the bridge into oncoming traffic
Caused a massive forty-two car pile-up, not a scratch at all
Hopped up holdin' an axe and saw
Jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tabasco sauce
Spittin' flames, kickin' fire out your ass, you little bastard
You can pass it on, I'm battery acid, dawg
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playin' basketball when I'm goin' through crack withdrawal
Dick so big it's like elastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of Plastic Man with a drastic force
And went spastic, put my penis on classic sports

[Verse 4: Mr. Porter]
Haha, look, look-
I shoot straight off the hip
Trey-eight off the grip, see, I ain't fo' that shit
I got a fist print fo' yo' lip
Lookin' shit is swole up like the stomach on a fat pregnant bitch
And it's evident that I get chips like the president
Been a lotta rules, keep the tools for the haters left
Niggas ain't fadin' 'em, seal a crack, do a trim
Got a lot of dough, but you know I ain't trickin' on 'em
Get some head spinnin' on 'em, keep the head spinnin' on 'em
See, I ain't diggin' on 'em, keep the head hidden from 'em
You know how it go, no dough trickin' on 'em
She just wanna blow, see what she can get from 'em
But she don't know my name, I'm 'bout the game, I'm pickin' on her
Wrist so cold that my left hand's numb as summer
I rip a hole 'til she don't want you gettin' on her
She makes you wonder if the women even want ya
Mr. Porter, keep a ho in order
Learned it from my daddy, I teach it to my daughter
Ya oughta know the quota of my whole workout
I float like Noah and I don't want the boat to rover bounce
Yeah, yeah

[Spoken: Eminem & Mr. Porter]
Yeah, hey, ayy, let's change that beat, homie
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where's the swag juice, Al?
Come on, homie
Swag drip
Swag is dryin' up right now
Where's the swag?

[Plays ""Microphone"" by Slaughterhouse]

[Spoken: Eminem]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All right, all right
Yeah, yeah
Yo

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Once again it's the sinister, cynical, minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administer of the pain, just finished huffin' the paint
And muffled the fumes like it was nothing because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he spray reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacin' stares, he glares makin' the hairs
All on the back of your neck stand like Dracula, yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yeah, Angela so I command you to start dancin'
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwin' animal parts at Scarlett Johansson
Enter my gas chamber, ya gangsta, my ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table

[Verse 6: Mr. Porter]
I'm so obnoxious, open hand slap a nigga, you wouldn't
See, you couldn't, you went off cryin' like Cuba Gooding
I swan dive in your bitch pussy, I call her puddin'
She love her some nani, I love the bitch cookin'
Scrap back, you niggas weak as Chuck Nevitt
I fuck buckin' naked; Jesus piece swing reckless
Entrepo-po head honcho, hope you're ready 'fore
I pop his ass, nigga, kickin' through your door
You send goons to do your work
I send goons to mommas in church, I've been a problem since birth
Got a middle finger up her skirt
I don't ask a bitch on a date, I ask her can I fuck her first
See y'all with this Runyon shit
I made something out of nothing, I'm a hustler, bitch
I keep a nine tucked burnin' up beside of my hip
Gotta make a hit for any nigga for fifty thousand chips, bitch

[Verse 7: Eminem]
I'm checkin' the exposure of photos of me exposin'
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel, posin'
With or without clothing, next to the decomposin'
Bodies erodin' while I'm dozin' off, overdosin'
Windows opening-shutting, doors opening-closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only s'posed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not jokin', I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standin' over the sink posin'
Myself, self-loathin', 'cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think, ""This will make everything rosy
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severin' three toesies""
Totally frozen while I close in, I'm yodellin'
""Rosey, won't you come out to play""
Ain’t no sense, wastin' time, cuttin' and pastin' headlines
In the papers, makin' shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put neurofens in my syrup and stir them
You never heard him like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies 'cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events and then he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels and
Still can spin straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol -- three pills, the Real Slim
Shady's entered the building
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildrid
He's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, MCs'll get fricasseed on the grill then

[Spoken: Mr. Porter & Tim Westwood]
Woah, I like.... Fuck
Right now, building's on fire, fuck you

[Plays ""Chonkyfire"" by OutKast]

[Verse 8: Eminem]
You wanna start with the hook first?
You wanna start with the...oh
I have no idea what I'm doin'
I have no idea what I'm doin', but
Everybody get up, sit up, Christopher
They're miserable without you, Superman is a-
-live and he's flowin' like the Mystic River
Girl, don't act like you've never been kissed before
One, two, three, four, five, six, this-a
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How didn't anybody ever find me? I disa-
-ppeared, I was hidin' in Freeway's beard, just a
Hop, skip and I jump from my skin gushin'
Nails into my face that I been pushin'
Hellraiser, my face is my pin cushion
It's like when I'm on the mic, I can squish a
Sucker like a vise grip, my pen put ya
In the slaughterhouse 'cause your style's been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw, take off like the blades on
My brain's on hyperdrive, someone put the brakes on

[Chorus: Eminem & Mr. Porter (Both)]
Here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
Now here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it (Huh-uh), ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice (Yeah), my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice (Okay, look)

[Verse 9: Mr. Porter]
I got it figured out now, nigga, see
My—my mind's right, money right, can't nobody stoppin' how I get it
In hindsight I never should've left where I was livin'
I probably wouldn't be gettin' pressed by all these women
But then again, I wouldn't have met the ones that I was diggin'
So now I like to look and talk a lot like
She like Lil Kim and Kim and, um, Serena Williams
Just like my [?] I'm a regular Charles Dickens
Bitch, called me talkin' 'bout she pregnant
She praised me so I Mannie Fresh'd that ho and left baby
I'll never trust her, no
Shit, even if she specialize in mouth massagin' my testicles
I never trusted her a whole lot
Even on the first day we met, she's basically gettin' her mouth raped
Then turn around and ask me for a kiss, ""No, bitch, I'm straight""
I never really been concerned with how my own dick taste

[Pre-Chorus: Mr. Porter & Eminem]
I think I'm 'bout to slip on my swag juice
I think I'm 'bout to slip on your swag juice
Oh no! No, no, don't slip on your swag juice!
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm 'bout to slip on my swag juice

[Chorus: Eminem]
So here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice
Alright

[Verse 10: Eminem]
Slim is in the house, simmer down there, sister
Bound to get you dizzy 'cause he gets as busy as a
Bee; baby, you could throw a frisbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he? He's a wizard
Standin' in the disco with a disco biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't Bisquit, is it?
Now, baby, don't forget to bring your lipstick wit' ya
I want the kiss 'fore I blow this bitch to smithe-
-reens, get the guillotines, this is a situ-
-ation that's critical as Dre spins his, uh
Turntables and he cuts the record like a scissor
Checka-chicky-checka-chicky-checka-checka-chicka
We'll wreck it in a second, tell me what the heck is sicker
Wait a minute, I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now, baby, just to make a little breakfast and it's six o'-
-clock in the morning 'less you want to get some dessert

[Chorus: Eminem & Mr. Porter (Both)]
So here's a smidgen, a midget to get your Bridgets, digit
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice
I said, here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag, my swag juice

[Outro, Spoken: Eminem & Tim Westwood]
Yeah, ayo, just so everybody knows, that was a hook that we made on the way to the radio station and we were tryin' to get it right so we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever, but this is what we were tryin' to, like, work out before we came here
Especially for Westwood, man! 'Specially for you, homie!
Damn, Eminem, thanks for listening, baby"

Farewell

[Intro]
Ricky Racks
For what it's worth
You were a slut at birth
If the world had a dick
You'd fuck the Earth
I tried to get over you
It doesn't work
You're still a cunt
I'm still a fucking jerk

[Verse 1]
Same as it ever was, yeah
Say it'll change but it never does
Ain't gonna ever 'cause
You're the cause of my pain and the medicine
Never met someone who played games with my head as much
Fate tethered us together like two felons
Must've fell in love with skeletons
Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but (Yeah)
Feels like I slept with the (Uh) wicked stepmother
But how the hell am I
Still in love with the motherfucking chick there's at least a million of?
They say love the one you with
But this shit is killing us
Our love's on some other shit
I'm a glutton for punishment
You're the gloves, I'm the punching mitts
It's above and beyond us
Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven
If I catch you sucking another dick
You better unsuck it, you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again
Why am I tucking you in?
Probably 'cause

[Chorus]
I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

[Verse 2]
Wanna hold you, wanna choke you, wanna love you
Wanna hate you, wanna kill you, wanna hurt you
Wanna heal you, yeah
Wanna lose you, keep you, bruise you
Beat, abuse you, treat you mutual
It's juvenile, delusional, as usual
You're beautiful, I'm average (Woo)
I'm brutal, you're a savage
My ride or die chick who's always cruising for a bruising
Yeah, it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick
Though we might get along like shit
Fight, hit, bite, spit, unite, split
Yeah, you're awful, but you're mine
And they say love is blind, we see each other fine
But it's no wonder I'm (Yeah) the only one you'll find (Uh)
To put up with your shit (What?), I need a plumber line (Yeah)
But nothing comes to mind (Nah) besides the number 90 (No)
'Cause since '06 you flipped my fucking life, upside down
Now the sky's ground, look at my frown, it's a smile now
Look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows, make it rain upwards
We're on that ninth cloud, two insane lovebirds
I should fly south, 'cause man am I great, ain't lyin' to myself
But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm Audi five thou'
But this is my house, bitch, you get out
Then we duke it out, then it dies down
Then we say, ""Fuck it"", cry our eyes out
Then...

[Chorus]
I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

[Verse 3]
This relationship is all that it's cracked up to be
Never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts
'Cause that's what attracts us
Trick you with a back rub
Tell you to relax then dump your ass in the bathtub (Haha)
Yeah, now that's love, may sound pathetic
But fuck the world 'cause they out to get us
I love you but I won't exchange vows
Hey now, don't get carried away
No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wed us
Yeah, but we're so insane ‘bout each other
May take the same route and way out as Junior Seau
Break out Berettas, lay down in bed and blow our brains out together
Who knows how it's gonna play out?
Or whether death's what our ending will be
One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee
But I'll go to bat for you, defending your honor
Yeah, no contingency fees, something we’re not, nah
We're not pretending to beef, don't cost a penny to be with me
Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke
Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing
Could've been a 50 cent ring from out of a vending machine
Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea
Guess I'm a prisoner, see, addiction is a disease

[Chorus]
I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

[Outro]
Love you girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah"

In Your Head

[Intro: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin' like holdin'
Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just died, so in
Case you're wonderin' why are my insides showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine, so I'm
Pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of relapse

[Chorus: The Cranberries (Eminem)]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
As an adult, amazing: back then I put anything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it! …Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I didn’t (A) mean and (B) just ain’t me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen
Let's strip away everything and see the main reason that I
Feel like a lame piece of shit, I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy
And lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy, what's in my—

[Chorus: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh"
"[Title]
Remind Me

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo! I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt-chin
Callin' all party animals, get
On the floor when I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who's stacked and so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go with
I spot you at first glance and go ""shit!""
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what, huh?
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow ""whee""
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why—

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Interlude: Eminem]
You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too
With me on it

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinkin' soon this tramp'll lean so we should bounce
But you're outta your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why—

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Bridge: Eminem & Joan Jett & The Blackhearts]
Said ""Can I take you home, where we can be alone?""
Shorty, you the shit, girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceilin'
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Beside ya fired up like a starter pistol
Crystal, let's slide hon, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung
We might wind up on mound like we're tryin' for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house
Screwin' our brains out like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, I’m fallin' in like, that's kinda, why I love

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)"

Rain Man

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
Definitely, definitely
Definitely dope
Definitely
Definitely K-Mart
Yeah, yeah (*fart*)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for finding me offensive
Hence, if I should draw out or line any fences
If so, to what extent, if any, should I go?
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I
Had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must've put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super-man
And how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Verse 2: Eminem (Dr. Dre)]
Now in the bible, it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad
Long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during, or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way
But who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre (What up?) I got a question if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt butt when he tees off (Yeah)
But, but, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out, ""Hut-hut""
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details, but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut because

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Verse 3: Eminem (Dr. Dre)]
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whoop ass canister
Goddammit Dre, where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway, I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yup, yup, don't worry, I'm on it
I got it, high-five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon, I
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can
And zoomed, I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
'Cause...
Yup, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre
Super-dope beatmaker
2000 and, 2400 and 87 million, 900 and se-73,400 and 63... and 70

Stay Wide Awake

[Intro]
Yo, yo, follow me (follow me)
Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and, oh, so cold, it's, oh, so cold
Oh, so cold, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
(Stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

[Verse 1]
Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, put my car in park, and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda, and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl, you mighta
Heard of me before, see whore, you're the kind of girl that I'd a–
-ssault and rape, then figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kind of guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah, now let's see her have triplets, and I'll di–
-sintegrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde–
-hyde and cyanide, girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
No need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun out of
Murderin', I'd rather go vinn-vinn, and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uhh
Shit, wait a minute, I mean skull, my knife seems dull, pull another one out, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
(Stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

[Verse 2]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide-and-seek like Jason, I'm so hungry
She's naked, see, no privacy, but I can see she wants me
So patient, see, I try to be, but gee, why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front, see
So blatantly, but silently 'cause I know that she's sound 'sleep
""Who's wakin' me so violently, and why's he on top of me?""
""He's rapin' me,"" she tries to scream, ""Somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me, he's bitin' me, he's laughin' like it's funny""
She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me, she's scratchin' like some dumb freak
Escapin' me, no dice, you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee, what a sight to see, I'm dancin' in my red panties
I'm crazy, but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancin' to quite a different drum beat

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
(Stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

[Verse 3]
Better try to stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch, your soul I'ma try to take
Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must've just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, biddy-bye-bye, biddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazin' skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam, so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt? There's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's comin' in from the back

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
(Stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)"

If I Had...

[Intro]
""Life,"" by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
And disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearin' that they was always down
What is life? I'm tired of life

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committin' so many sins
Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never havin' any ends
Tired of havin' skinny friends, hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins
Tired of not havin' a deal
Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
Tired of drownin' in my sorrow
Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off
At $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk
I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Tired of not bein' a millionaire

[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of bein' white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not havin' a phone
Tired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not drivin' a BM
Tired of not workin' at GM, tired of wantin' to be him
Tired of not sleepin' without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performin' in a packed coliseum
Tired of not bein' on tour
Tired of fuckin' the same blonde whore
After work, in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones
Havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns
Tired of bein' stared at
Tired of wearin' the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on ""Nobody's As Ill As Me""
And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs
Tired of JLB sayin', ""Where hip-hop lives""

[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit, tellin' me to be positive
How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
You know what I'm sayin'?
Right now, I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm just fed up, that's my word"

In Too Deep

[Verse 1]
""This could never work,"" is what we said at first
But whatever this is, it's working
But we're in two different worlds and (Yeah)
I'm not your husband (Nah), you ain't my girlfriend
All I know is that (What?)
When I'm with you, I'm a different person, yeah
And I ain't never met a chick as perfect
Girl, you're a ten, so here I am (Yeah)
Laying here with her again
Thinking 'bout you
She's asleep, you're texting me around two
Crying face emoji, you say, ""This is me without you""
We're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
Sex in the car, then I'll text you tomorrow
Do I question it? Nah, no objection at all
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is

[Chorus]
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep

[Verse 2]
You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me
He's asleep, you say, ""Let's meet around three""
You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out
You thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah
You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him
When he stumbles in, like, ""Where the fuck you've been?""
Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears
But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt
You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt
But now the lines are getting super blurred
Can't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her
But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love
Hope they don't overhear us talk
'Cause we both are getting sloppy
Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep

[Verse 3]
We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us
'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous
Of each other being someone else's
Call us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish
But I just wanna see ya
Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6
If I'm there with ya, rich or poor
When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor
I could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'
I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah
I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all
So once a year or twice a month I'm here if you want it
Yeah, I'm open season
And I'm always game, so I keep it a hundred, dear, haha
'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring
So it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because

[Chorus]
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)"

Go to Sleep

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe 'til I see what I wanna see
And what I wanna see is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently; you're just being hurt
This ain't gonna work for me, it just wouldn't be
Sufficient enough 'cause we are just gonna be
Enemies as long as we breathe, I don't ever see
Either of us comin' to terms where we can agree
There ain't gonna be no reasonin' speakin' with me
You speak on my seed, then me no speak-a Inglés
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin', unless
You're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face-to-face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
And you're gonna see this gangster pee on himself
I see you D12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need 15 of my homies
When I see you, I'm seein' you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me! Pick me up, throw me!
Lift me up, hold me—just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too

[Chorus: Eminem & DMX]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Die, motherfucker, die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
We got you niggas nervous, on purpose
To hurt your focus, you's not MC's
You's worthless, you's not them G's
You's a circus, you's no appeal, please
Use curtains, you use words Kool Herc slurred
In two-thousand-third: you's perpin'
You's no threat, who's you servin'?
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth
Shady, mothafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold I become more cursed
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse
Is he who depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the desk
Use not your chest, nigga, use a vest
Before tools choose your rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth

[Chorus: Eminem & DMX]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Die, motherfucker, die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Verse 3: DMX]
Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast (Yeah), talk like the streets (Yeah)
I'ma stay blazin' New York with the heat (Yeah)
Stalk on the beat (Yeah), walk with my feet (Ugh!)
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet (What!)
Peep how I'm movin' (Uh-huh), peep where I'm goin' (Uh-huh)
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin' (Woo!)
But I'ma keep growin', gettin' larger than life
Easy goin' with the same one that started the fight
He be knowin' how dog get when dog don't bite (Ugh!)
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life (Ugh!)
Grand Champ, and my Blood Line is tight (What!)
'Cause it's all good (Yeah!), 'cause it's all right (Come on!)
Niggas tried to holla but couldn't holla back
Now they got to swallow everything in the sack
Blood Line, and we can go track for track
Damn, dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that?

[Chorus: Eminem & DMX]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Die, motherfucker, die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Outro: Eminem & DMX]
All you motherfuckers, take that! (Ugh!)
Here, take this too, bitch!
Uh, uh, uh, uh, wahoo!
We're killing all you motherfuckers dead
All of you! Fake-ass gangsters!
No more press! No more press!
Rot, motherfuckers, rot! (Uh-huh!)
Decay, in the dirt, bitch, in the motherfuckin' dirt!
Die nameless, bitch! Die nameless!
No more fame! Ahh, hahahaha
Yo, X, come on, man! (Woo!) Obie, let's go! Ha ha"

Little Engine

[Intro: Alfred Hitchcock]
I trust that everyone is enjoying the music
As the title of the album suggests
This was meant for your listening pleasure
While you are being done in

[Verse 1]
Call this evil intent, like me in a limo (Yeah)
Like the shade in these windows
Smoke gray, ladies go mental
But no way they can see in though (Nah)
OJ blade is a pencil (Yeah)
Propane takin' my cranium
Code-name Titanium Temple
I almost swallowed my car
I call my Mercedes a Benzo
Bitch, I ball like a baby
Ball like J, but not Jay as in
Jay-Z, J as in Leno
’Cause I got a huge mansion
No, huge man chin, new Manson, loose cannon
Too scandalous, Sue Atkins
The kinda crazy you can't fix
I'm still the one that your parents hate
I’m in your house eatin' carrot-cake
While I sit there and wait and I marinate
I'm irritated, you 'bout to meet a scary fate
And come home to find yourself starin' straight into a fuckin' barrel like Sharon Tate
Raise the concerto while I narrate
Yeah, you be on the straight and narrow like a fuckin' arrow shape
I be on a higher plane in aerospace
With so much leg-room and air space on this airplane
Unlike you 'cause you’re on a flight too, but it’s a staircase

[Chorus]
Now, little engine go, finna vrin-vrin go
I'm losin’ control
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Overd-d-dose
Time to Ri-Rick Roll, up the en-endo
Like a win-window
Little engine gone, little engine

[Verse 2]
I am the top-selling, who cares?
Stop dwelling, then stop yelling
I'm not yelling, you're yelling
Smart-aleck, goddammit
Fuck is that? Stop hammering (Goddamn)
That's what it sounds like in my brain
Much as I fight to restrain
I have the right to remain violent
Any rhyme that I say can and will be used against you
Icicle veins, mics will get slain
Life, it will strangle you with bicycle chain
You’re gonna have to come identify the remains
Wait, what?
I said my head is twisted like a bread tie (Yup)
Can't get a fuckin' word in, edgewise (Shut up)
Success overnight like a red-eye (Bitch)
Dressed like a Jedi at a Best Buy on the Westside
I'm hot dog, no you're not, I'm the guy with the Oscar at Meijers
In appliances by the washers and dryers
Chick ran up like, ""Marshall on fire""
I looked down and said, ""No, I'm not, you're a liar""
She said, ""No, your music""
Heard you're back with the Doctor and I heard

Now, little engine go, finna vrin-vrin go
I'm losin' control
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Overd-d-dose
Time to Ri-Rick Roll, up the en-endo

This must be how bein' hoodrich feels
Was a ghetto boy, now I ball out like Bushwick Bill (Hi-ho)

Blueface meets Albert DeSalvo
Balboa with a scalpel
Scoundrel hound with a mouth full of Alpo

Talkin’ 2 Myself

[Intro: Eminem]
Ayo, before I start this song, man
I just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins
On the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God, it feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
""Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself, you're slowly dyin'
You're denyin' your health is declinin' with your self-esteem
You're cryin' out for help""

[Chorus: Kobe and Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kobe]
Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (Oh-oh, oh)
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself
Do something 'bout it, admit you got a problem
Your brain is clouded, you pouted long enough
It isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I picked myself up off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore, I was on drugs; Relapse, I was flushin' 'em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um…

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Outro: Eminem]
So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm back! (I'm back!)
Ha-ha (Ha-ha)"

Remember Me?

Remember me? Seven executions
Remember me? I have no remorse
Remember me? I'm high-powered
Remember me? I drop bombs, like Hiroshima

[Verse 1: RBX]
For this one, they scream ""X, you retarded?!""
'Cause I grab the mic and get down like syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses
Without boundaries, which qualifies me
For the term “universal” without no rehearsal
I leak words that's controversial
Like I'm not the one you wanna contest, see
'Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
That got banned from TV, heavyweight getup
Hit you, watch your whole head split up
Loco is the motion, we comin' through
Hollow-tips is the lead the .45 threw

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
Remember me? Throw ya gunz in the air!
Remember me? Slam! Slam!
Remember me? Nigga, bacdafucup!
Remember me? Chka-chka-Onyx!

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Niggas that take no for an answer get told no
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like “No! No! No!”
Life's a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit, it's all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead of the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta with metal Beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence, nope, never leave a shred of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My mom's got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga? Pbbt, you better dead that shit
My name should be Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit
Probably sayin' he ain't a killer, but I'm killin' myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw on the kitchen floor
So think what I'ma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do? Cocksuckers, we Glock busters
'Til the cops cuff us, gon' start ruckus and drop blockbusters
Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm gettin' wires, niggas wantin' me dead
Wantin' my head, you think it could be somethin' I said?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Remember me? I just don't give a fuck!
Remember me? Yeah, fuck you too!
Remember me? I'm low down and I'm shifty!
Remember me? I'm Shady!

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
When I go out, I'ma go out shootin'
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid!
I'm tryin' to clean up my fuckin' image
So I promised the fuckin' critics I wouldn't say “fuckin'” for six minutes
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats
Six sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen, with M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?!
Fuck that! Pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at!
(What the fuck you starin' at, nigga?)

[Outro: Eminem]
Don't you remember me?!
Remember me?!
Remember me?!
Remember me!! (Slim Shady!)"

Under the Influence

[Hook: Eminem]
Chem-le-le-le-le-le-le-le, le-le, le-le
Chem-le-le-le-ne-miah-nuf-niah, ne-nish, ne-ne (Translation:)
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young-ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital, lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantel
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
(Bitch, it's too late)
‘Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

[Verse 2: Swifty]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, ""Forgive me""
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type
That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

[Hook: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
‘Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performin'?) Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?
The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) No, bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip, lettin' the record skip (Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost three-hundred dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin'-ass mom

[Verse 4: Proof]
Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin'– nigga, pass that!
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a ""Stop the Violence"" rally, I blast gats
BMI on publishin'; get yo' ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up yo' cash stack
Run yo' motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch, I snatched Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
‘Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, ‘cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted; I cock it back, then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga screamin', ""Kuniva, yo, yo!""
I leave ya face leakin', run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin'
Take a swing at the deacon

[Verse 6: Kon Artis]
I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' them shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery) I sign to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

[Hook: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
‘Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Outro: Eminem]
Ha-ha! Suck my motherfuckin' dick!
D12, Dirty-motherfuckin'-Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands
Bizarre Kid, Swifty McVay, the Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Derty Harry, and Slim Shady"

Tragic Endings

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
I'm stumbling, I can’t see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

[Refrain: Skylar Grey]
Now I’m the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

[Verse 2: Eminem]
All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrassed, I don’t want no one else to see
’Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn’t help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I’m wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
'Cause I know she loves me—my friends, what do they know?

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
Gets goin' she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
But, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Refrain: Skylar Grey]
Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health
But it annoys her to see me get the strength to say, ""Screw her!""
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it!
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)"

Won’t Back Down

You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

Cadillac Sevilles, coupe DeVilles
Brain-dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth-and-nail
Tryna fight it, try to deny it, stupid, you will feel
What I do, I do at will
Shootin' from the hip, yeah, boy, I shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my deathbed
Screamin', “F that!” – yeah, super-ill
Baby, what the deal? We can chill
Split a half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak, slut, I'll cut my toes off
And step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill
Listen, garden tool, don't make me introduce you
To my power tool, you know the fuckin' drill
How you douchebags feel knowin' you're disposable?
Summer's Eve, Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal
Baby, crank the shit, 'cause it's your goddamn jam
You said that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well, shorty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium
And said, “Settle your fuckin' ass down!
I'm ready for combat, man!”
Get it? Calm Batman, nah
Ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like Mom's CAT-scans
'Cause they fuckin' go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show 'em how it's done
Spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah

You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
Playin' with an etch-a-sketch
Bet you that you'll never guess
Who's knockin' at your door, people hit the floors
Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gon' get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads
With Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, ma'fucker
You ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
Other words, I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick—shit, I need six inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch, need I remind you
That I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here—need a fix, ock?
I'm the big shot—get it, dick-snots?
You're just small pokes, little pricks
Girl, you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Before I sit back and let him get hotter
Better call the cops on him quick, fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass
White trash with a half a six-pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitch attached to the back, dispatch

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'?
Does a bird chirp? Does Lil' Wayne slurp 'zurp
'Til he burps and smoke purp?
Does a word search get circles wrapped around it
Like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do
When I'm on the mic
Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to
Psych! I'm spikin' you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stain—bitch, you listenin'?
Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you
Turn me back up! Are you insane?!
Tryin' to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is lightning
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin' ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty
On this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!
I'm the shit—why you think Proof used to call me ""Doody""?

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no"

Never Love Again

[Verse 1]
I could be with anybody, I choose you
Still, it's no excuse to abuse you
But no one knows what I'm goin' through, so I'd use you
To be truthful, I wouldn't know what to do if I lose you
So I refuse to, might have a screw loose and a fuse blew
But I think I might be buildin' up a tolerance to you
'Cause one minute I'm hollerin', ""Screw you""
Next, I take it back, guess you can say I'm tryna unscrew you
But the shit's about to pop off, yeah, I feel you up
Then I got you totally open as soon as I take your top off
You're so hard to resist, you knock my socks off
My friends say you're bad for me, hogwash

[Chorus]
I'll never love again
The way I loved you
Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
Used to always have my back

[Verse 2]
Some days it feels like you're all that I have
That's why I'm tryna hold onto you for as long as I can
And you just want me for my money so I got you wrapped all in saran
Damn, talk about eatin' out the palm of my hand
But if not for my financials
I wouldn't have you anyways, there have been ample
Plenty days, where I'm just in a daze and I can't pull
Myself up out this rut and you're so much of a handful
I can only take so much of you all at one time
Because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes
Gotta take you in doses, but when you're not at my side
I shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
Yeah, baby, we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious
Combination? We know, it's like playin' with explosives
Quite dangerous though, but my brain's in hypnosis
Such a wide range of emotions
Migraines, but why the fuck am I takin' these MOTRINs?
Ibuprofens, like a drop of rain in the ocean
And you're my fix on the days when I'm broken
But the shit's about to go sideways, I just know it

[Chorus]
I'll never love again
The way I loved you
Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
Used to always have my back

[Verse 3]
So I spiral downwardly 'cause I'm too cowardly to leave you
Head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality
Somehow it seems like when I lay me down to sleep I'm counting sheep
You're bound to creep
'Cause every time I turn around, you keep runnin' out on me
You're my Xanax and my valium, I'm an addict, you're a downer
You're my habit, it's like I found you in the cabinet
But it's like I can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof
A scoundrel and fiend's how I feel around you
Awful, every time I lost you, felt like I had you in my pocket
Now I'm flippin' over the furniture, punchin' holes in the walls through
Everything that we've gone through
How many times you've fucked me
But the way it felt for me to be on top when I was on you
Swore my fealty, but word to G.O.D
I thought you loved me, bitch, you tried to kill me, I'm getting off you
Quit callin' for me, hard proof's how I respond to
The Ambien and Tylenols too
Fuck all you

[Outro]
Fuckin' bitch
We're done"

Stepdad

[Intro]
Ayo
(This a song about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if this ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

[Verse 1]
One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my Ma
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, it’s probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with Mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
Our dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!

[Chorus]
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

[Verse 2]
Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times
He swatted me with it, I'd cry
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I wish I could just jaw him
If I could get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection
And put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon (Saigon)
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium-ion
Then Mom and him let bygones (Bygones)
Just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
But this is why I...

[Chorus]
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

[Verse 3]
So this year, I'm goin' into the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry
Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes, ""Oops"" and just laughs
I yelled for Mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, ""Fuck you, punk"" and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
""Ding-dong,"" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two-liter with
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em

[Chorus]
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)"

Heat

[Intro: John C. Reilly]
Wanna take it from the top?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass-cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you, I actually
Said to myself: ""I gotta meet her"" like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic
But I'm stiff as a statue you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'ma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (Meow!), hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I wanna fack

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (Fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore are like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull out behind you when you're leavin'
And you don't even know it (Word, yo Rick, man!)
She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air for some to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit!
""Ain't steppin' to you, bitch,"" I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
(Could you repeat that again?)
""Letter"" come to me—""mail."" ""Sweater"", ""heat,"" ""some degree.""  Fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her Dodge Viper, wood is so bright
I ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said—

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg (& John C. Reilly)]
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (Fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hole musta been dug
'Cause it just died like food coloring (Duh!)
So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona
With an ass to match, girl
Your body is lit, you're striking, I'm a gas
Girl, you're just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too—look at my pedigree! (Roof!)
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger, too
Unless it's the middle one to finger you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg & John C. Reilly]
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Outro: Eminem & Mark Wahlberg]
On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin (Girls!)
He's mixin' it up for me, and you're in
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
I wanna fuck, it's my big dick
So everybody get ready fucking now!"

Almost Famous

[Intro]
I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost see it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost taste it

[Spoken: Eminem]
Yeah, can't stop now
This might be the last chance I get to be famous
(I just wanna be famous)

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster, you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around when his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out, that's what I call blowin' your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come, screaming ""Attack!"" like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit, his britches, he outgrowed 'em
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dyin' of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em, then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy
Who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce?
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backin' down?
You must be out of your dang skulls; I'm almost famous

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm back for revenge, I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin; I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'Fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern and smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick! 'Dick''s too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!
Don't call me the Champ, call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger; matter fact, I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Mes
See, he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs, you're BBs: you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E
He's almost famous

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads
He ain't givin' them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, ""Ahh!""
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked
Instead of suckin' him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it, he's fuckin' had it
He's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
And while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous"

Seduction

[Intro: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Like a verbal seduction when
Seduction when I tell 'em girls on the floor
I don't know, man (Geh-geh-geh)
Just feels like we're a lot different (Right now)
(Girls on the floor) It kinda feels like (Like a verbal seduction when)
I'm on a whole different page right now than you (Girls on the floor)
It feels strange, but umm (Girls on the floor)
I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I feel like I'm morphin' into somethin' that's so incredible
That I'm dwarfin' all competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, such passion, you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her, yet you strong-arm
You're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop the Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, ""C'mon, son!""
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like, ""She's fuckin' with dude, she wants some""
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack when she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track?

[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
She's sittin' there gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a seven-disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not — aww!
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet: a star
And I'm not about to sit back
And just keep rhymin' one syllable — naw!
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough, but I'm not givin' up
'Til I get my respect and I won't stop 'til I get enough
'Cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations (Aww!)
That hater alarm is soundin' off
And Obama took the bomb from my name (Aww!)
So quit cryin' that I took your dame, homie, she's my dame (Aww!)
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank, boy
But you got a hard-on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it

[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's like we're playin' lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl? Come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear
While I freak this world premiere
Seducin' her, loosen up
With a little freestyle that'll— wait, am I losin' ya?
Am I makin' you look bad? Well, I got news for ya
Homie, you losin' her
Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryin' to show how? Let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow-out
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it, punk, but none of it's fuckin' with me
Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit?
You think you killin' them syllables? Quit
Playin', these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall: I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe-struck
She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From suckin' my dick... aw, fuck

[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)"

My Mom

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay!
Alright, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo
Alright, I'ma lay the chorus first
Here we go now!

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

[Verse 1]
My mom, my mom, I know you're probably tired
Of hearin' 'bout my mom, oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas in my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an undera-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
""What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?""
""Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer""
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleepin'
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
Go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra!

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner!
""You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers, now just wait
'Til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make
That retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fuckin' place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving
And if you still ain't finished it, I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip, it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid!""

[Bridge 1]
My mom
There's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on, 'cause—

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

[Bridge 2]
My mom loved Valium, now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh!

[Verse 3]
Man, I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
A tragedy, the fuckin' past ended up catchin' me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
""Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it""
But I don't need it — ""Well fuck it then, break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up""
Alright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop it, gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip, then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

[Outro]
My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Me momma, I like-a da momma
Haha, sorry Mom
I still love you though!
Dr. Dre, 2010
Hey, this shit is hella hard, homie
Yo, take us on outta here

Bagpipes from Baghdad

[Intro]
Oh, it's music to my ears, oh man
How can I describe the way I feel?
Fucking great, man
Okay, let me see
How could I begin?

[Verse 1]
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up, an in-between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, what ever happened to us?
Why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread, Satin Funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean, I really want you bad, you cunt
Nick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad—

[Verse 2]
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster
My signature sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow
Man, what an ensemble!
What an assortment of pharma–ceuticals
This beautiful pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on Malachai
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck o', shuck o' corn, Chaka Khan
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck, and
Told him it's fuckin' on, man, what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're runnin' over the snowblower with the lawnmower
Blowin' your bagpipes from Baghdad

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag

[Verse 3]
In the bed with two brain-dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty-fuckin' you 'til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what I said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going, girlfriends? You needs a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate 'Chips Ahoy!' chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid pic

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag
Oh, bagpipes from Baghdad

Nail in the Coffin

[Intro]
This motherfucker, man!
Just won't shut up, will you?
Talking 'bout I owe him
Bitch, you owe me!
I'm promotin' you right now
Yo, let's put the nail in this coffin!

[Hook]
I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (nope)
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that
So, put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

[Verse]
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
An 83-year-old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me?
Please don't—you'll probably fall with me
And our asses'll both be history
But then again you'd finally get your wish
‘Cause you'll be all over the street, like 50 Cent
Fuckin' punk pussy! Fuck you, chump!
Give me a one-on-one, see if I don't fuck you up
Tried to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck
Dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'
You sit behind a fuckin' desk at The Source butt-kissin'
And beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you can't even get the clearances
'Cause real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we don't like you—we hate you, period
Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
Last week you was shakin' Obie Trice's hand
Now he's a buster? What the fuck's with that?
Get on a track dissin' us, kissin' 50's ass
And askin' me what I know about indictments, bite me!
Bitch, I got two cases and probation—fight me!
What do I know about standin' in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicin' her wrists
Right in front of the only thing that you have in this world
A little girl?
And I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I don't know shit about no choppin' rocks
But what you know about Hip Hop Shops rockin' spots
Where you the only white boy up in that bitch just rippin'?
Pressin' up your own fliers and your stickers, stickin'
Them bitches up after spendin' six hours at Kinko's
Just makin' copies of your covers of cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spendin' your whole paychecks at Disc Makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life?
Oh, that's right, you should know what that's like
You're half white; Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
I'm eatin' you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
If you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down!
You should be out killin' motherfuckers right now
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill him dead, bitch!
Shoot 'em in the fuckin' head—go ahead, bitch!
Slap my mom! Slap the fuck out of her!
She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of ya
‘Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke
If you was really sellin' coke, well, then what the fuck
You stop for, dummy? If you slew some crack
You'd make a lot more money than you do from rap
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what it's like to be rich
Life's a bitch, ain't it? Raymond?
Here, let me break the shit down in layman's terms for you, just to make sure that you
Can understand it and Canibus ain't using too many complicated fuckin' words for you
Here, let me slow it down for you
So that you could understand if I say it slower
Let it go, dog, it's over

[Hook]
I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear they grandfather rap (nope)
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that
So, put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

[Outro]
Haha… talking 'bout I have motherfuckers callin' your crib
Bitch, you ain't even got a fuckin' crib!
You ain't even got a fuckin' phone… fuckin' bum!
Threatenin' to shut me down at your lil' fuckin' Source magazine, if I come back on you and attack you
Bitch, you attacked me first!
Take it like a man, and shut the fuck up!
And fuck your little magazine too!
I don't need your little fuckin' magazine
I got XXL's number anyways
And y'all can't stand it, ‘cause they gettin' bigger than y'all
Oh, and by the way, how'd I look on the VMA's?
When you was watchin' me
From whatever fuckin' TV you was watchin' me from
From Boston… the mean streets of Boston
Fuckin' sissy! And you got us scared up in here, motherfucker
Suck our motherfuckin' dicks!
Oh! And for those that don't know
Don't get it twisted, y'all: The Source has a white owner!"

I don't know, but I don't want to
Grow up to be like Ja Rule's little dirty-ass kids
Ha ha, yeah, c'mon
G-G-G-G-G-G-G Unit
Hailie, come here, baby! Bring Daddy his Oscar!
We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass

[Verse 1: Swift]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead
And I ain't talking 'bout a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claiming you a murderer, and you spelled it wrong
You put E before the D, ‘cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
If he was still alive, you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch, keep it real
Life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you? They didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover, ‘cause he need it
And all you niggas hating, shut your mouths!
It's just that real niggas ain't buying that shit y'all put out

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Doe, rae, me, but we don't sing, motherfuckers
So Murder Inc, do your thing, motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team
Who expects nothin' less than R&B coming from that regime
""Regime"" is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billie Holiday – how it happen?
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
Told him, ""Reenact him, you go platinum!""
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenacting her boy
So I'm click-clackin' this toy, mash and destroy
Shady slash Aftermath and Detroit, motherfucker!

[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me ‘cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Now, we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious, nigga, you shook
You half of a half-way crook; get off X dick, go sing a hook!
Nigga, and you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga, please stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino, you ain't shit but a bitch!
Fuckin' old-ass, ignorant, innocent-lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on: is it me, or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
With them short ass arms, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holler and curse
Go ahead and respond
And pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

[Verse 4: Proof]
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up, Gotti? And this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggas?
Roll like a boss, in the streets they still feel us
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
You talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss, you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillac Pac or that transvestite?
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
You're just like a little windbox
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac
You Mockaveli; get your own identity!

[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me ‘cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Over hook]
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
Fuckin' punk-pussy bitch! I'll fuck you up, boy! Never!
Don't you never in your motherfuckin' life…
I'll choke the shit out of you little motherfuckin' midget
Hailie'll whip your motherfuckin' ass

[Outro: Obie Trice]
That's right, motherfuckers
Shady records, what you know about it?
Fuck Benzino! Fuck Ja Rule!
Nigga, this Obie Trice right here talkin' to you motherfuckers
Ja Rule punk ass, yeah, fuckin' Soul 4 Real ass
Nigga, that's Soul 4 Real
That the nigga from Soul 4 Real!
Candy Rain-ass nigga, he got a deal, now he rappin'
You don't know what's, faggot-ass motherfuckers
Get money to all my real niggas, man
Obie Trice, D-12, G Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade

[Outro: Hailie and Eminem]
Daddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?
No, honey, you guys are the same size"

Yeah, I'm sorry (Huh?)
What did you say?
Oh, I can't hear you
I have an ear infucktion and I cunt finger it out (Out), yeah (I need Auto-Tune)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
It's my alter ego's fault
These evil thoughts could be so dark
Cerebral palsy, three Zolofts
I eat, doze off to ""Rico Suave"" (Look it up)
Cadillac with a ladder rack in the back, with a cracked axel, a backpack full of Paxil
A black satchel, a knapsack and a flask full of 'gnac and Jack Daniels
Girl, let's go back-back to my castle (Yeah)
I don't wanna hassle you, Alexandra
But my dick's an acronym 'cause it stands for you (Stands for you, oh)
Wait, Alexandra who? (Damn)
All I know is Friday, I met you (What?)
Saturday, I'll probably forget you
Guess that's what the Molly and ex do (What the fuck?)
'Cause who the fuck am I laying next to? (Huh)
But evеr since D-Nice To Tha Rescuе, Fila Fresh Crew (Uh)
I been a lab rat (Yeah) from a test tube (Uh)
I'm goin' in-nn like the red roof (Red Roof Inn)
You don't like it, eat a cock 'til your jaw breaks (Yeah)
Call it caught between a rock and a hard place
Like a sasquatch in a crawlspace
'Cause you're watchin' your heart race like you're Scarface
In a car chase with the cops or an arcade
Stuck inside of a Mario Kart race duckin' saw blades
At a stop and a start pace
What I'm tryin' to say is I'm drivin' 'em all crazy

[Chorus]
I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I see the rap game, then attack the verses (Uh)
Turn into a graveyard packed with hearses (Yeah)
Just like your funeral, I'm at your service (What?)
Pockets 'on stuff' like a taxidermist (Woo)
Just landed in Los Angeles when this chick Angela and her grandmother in a tan
Colored van pull up with a handful of Xans
And a substantial amount of gan' just to ask what my
(Plans) plans for the night are (Yeah)
I said, ""Sneak into the Sleep Inn for the weekend and pretend it's a five-star,"" yeah
Or leap into the deep end of the pool
I can show you where the dives are (Get it?), ha
We don't even gotta drive far
I know this spot that is so live
But I'm tryna get some head first (What?), like a nosedive (Haha)
So many side chicks, can't decide which to slide with and which should I ditch
So when it comes to ass, bitch, I get behind like the Heimlich (Get behind, yeah)
Had one chick who liked to flip sometimes on some switchin' sides shit
Pushed her out the Sidekick, then I flipped the lil' white bitch off like a light switch (Bitch)
It's okay not to like my shit
Everything's fine, drink your wine, bitch
And get offline, quit whinin', this is just a rhyme, bitch (Rhyme, bitch)
But ask me, will I stick to my guns (Guns) like adhesive tape? (Adhesive tape)
Does Bill Cosby sedate once he treats to cheesecake and a decent steak? (Huh?)
You think gettin' rid of me's a piece of cake?
I'm harder than findin' Harvey Weinstein a date (Damn)
And that's why they say I got more lines than Black Friday
So save that sssshit for the damn library (Shh)
You heard of Kris Kristofferson? (Yeah)
Well, I am Piss Pissedofferson (Oh)
Paul's askin' for Christmas off again
I said, ""No,"" then I spit this song for him
It goes

I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Bitch, I can make ""orange"" rhyme with ""banana"" (Yeah)
Bornana
Eating pork rinds, sword fightin' in pajamas
At the crib, playin' Fortnite with your grandma
But I'm more like a four-five with the grammar
'Bout to show you why your five favorite rappers can't touch this
But before I get the hammer
I should warn you, I'm Thor-like in this manner (Thor)
But the day I lose sleep over you critiquin' me or
I ever let you cocksuckers eat at me
I'd need to be a motherfuckin' pizzeria
But you ain't gettin' no cheese from me
I went from Little Caesars, BLTses, grilled cheeses
Bein' dirt poor to filthy rich, I'm still me, bitch
Like a realtor, that's real tea (Realty), bitch (Real talk)
Aftermath, bitch, whole camp's lit
We put out fire, Dre stamps it
With my cohorts, hit a bogart
Yeah, got your whole squad yellin', ""Oh, God""
Here comes Barshall with no holds barred
Bitch, I'm a hurricane, you're a blowhard
Like your old broad, she full of semen (Sea men), like the coast guard
And life's been pretty good to me so far (Yeah), for the most part
Had a couple of run-ins with po-po, caught
A couple assault charges, got a few priors (Priers) like crowbars (Priors)
Which is so odd 'cause I'm forty-eight now
That 5-0's startin' to creep up on me like a patrol car (Woo)
I'll be an old fart, but you don't want no part, so, bitch, don't start (Don't start)
Simmer down, compose yourself, Mozart
I ain't went nowhere, call me coleslaw
'Cause I'm out for the cabbage and I'm so raw
And if time is money, you have no clocks
And any folk caught within close proximity's gettin' cold-cocked
My enemies, I'm a chimney, give me the smoke, opps
And R.I.P. to King Von, and it don't stop, and I know not
What the fuck you say? I told y'all, it ain't me, it's my alter ego's fault
But if y'all wanna cancel me, no prob
I'll tell you the same thing I told Paul (Woo)

[Chorus]
I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)

Book of Rhymes

[Intro]
I don't smile, I don't frown, get too up or get too down (Nah)
I was here, so were you, you came and went, I stuck around (Yeah)
Still here now, stop me how? Your opinion's like a broken calculator
That shit doesn't count
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth

[Chorus]
I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had
I said I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad (Yeah), every thought that I had (I'm eastside)

[Verse 1]
Haven't used all the tricks I have, so like my balls, I'm in my bag (My bag)
Get a littlе teste when I'm mad (I'm mad), sick of wrеstling this iPad (iPad)
Unsuccessfully, I might add (Might add)
And I know it's best to leave it lie
But even I get obsessed with reading everything
And let it get the best of me 'til I snap ('Til I snap)
But I need to get off the internet (Get off the internet)
I need to get on the mic (Get on the mic)
You need to get off the internet (Internet)
You need to get you a life
Why you waste time just to comment on shit? (Comment on shit)
Especially shit you don't like (Shit you don't like)
Don't like it, don't listen, but don't tell me 'bout your favorite rapper rippin' some shit he didn't write (Shit he didn't write)
What happened to Slim? He was no cap with the pen
He used to rap like the people his music was for
He was exactly like them
The dude who used to be poor, why can't he tap into him?
Can't use that excuse anymore
He's mad at the wind, he's in a nuclear war
With a cloud, he's yellin' at it again
I talked to your mother, she told me she loved me
All she wanna do is just hold me and hug me
Wants nobody but me, she showed me the Dougie
Can I get a witness like notary public? (Preach)
She said, ""Kick some fly shit"" (Fly shit)
I said, ""I got wings on my ass"" (Wings on my ass)
Told her my dick's a cockpit (Dick's a cockpit)
I fly by the seat of my pants (Seat of my pants)
Sinful thoughts, this beat is crazy, this shit's retarded
This instru's mental (This instru's mental) to mini-bars, incidental charges
When did it start? I been cold-hearted in this heart since kindergarten
Mental sharpness which makes Slim a walking dentist office, bitch, I invented flossin'
Yeah, I used to wonder (I used to wonder) where my next meal's gonna come from (Meal's gonna come from)
Now, I just wonder (Now I just wonder) where my next mill's gonna come from (Mill's gonna come from)
I cannot have no success (Have no success), unless when I finally make it (Finally make it)
I get to remind all the haters (Remind all the haters) who shitted on me when I'm on my way up (I'm on my way)
My floor is y'all fool's ceilings
If I was you, I would step or find yourself twisted
That's how you'll wind up like spiral stairs
I will swear on a stack of Bibles
I will tear new behinds out of rivals, even your idols, I don't care
It's Music to Be Murdered By, so Bon Iver can swallow a fuckin' Ja Rule bobblehead
And die slow like Alzheimer's (Ha-ha)
Lone sniper, I hold a microphone like a loaded rifle
My dome's brighter, all I spit from my skull's fire
All that's missing's a motorcycle with the chrome wires, spoke tires
And y'all are flow biters, so I don't gotta
Explain why they call me your ghostwriter

[Chorus]
I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had
I said I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had (Illa)

[Verse 2]
Haven't used all the tricks I have, so like my balls, it's in my bag
I tend to get a little testy when I'm mad
But gift of gab and pen to pad turn temper tantrums into anthems
Put lips to ass and kiss the cracks, spit your damnedest
You're still gonna hit the canvas
Rippin' rappers, veterans to whippersnappers
Mr. Mathers is killin' this shit, villainous wit with scant less
Syllables rip the planet, biblical shit's finna hit the fan
Anybody wanna go tit for tat's gonna get hit with that
Then the amygdala hippocampus is gonna trigger the ignoramus
To think of the most ridiculous shit to spit then
Pit it against these pitiful rappers
Insidious, these idiots wittiest shit against me shitty as MC Hammer's
Get your whole squad, send a task force in
If you want it, you're 'bout to get what you asked for then
Put your helmet on, strap your chin
You're 'bout to get you a crash course in
Who not to start a motherfuckin' rap war with
Or to go against, fuck would you wanna do that for?
No offense, but are you retards slow or dense?
A fuckin' penny has more sense
Yeah, now you gotta get killed, but it's not a big deal, but every thought is so ill
And so methodical, thought I swallowed a pill
I'm starting to feel like I'm an automobile
With Barnacle Bill inside the car at the wheel
Inside a carnival, 'cause I'm plowin' into everyone who wrote snidey articles
And that explains why the fuck you clowns are all in my grill
Joy and pain, fortune, fame, torture, shame, choice I made
Swore someday the world would pay less to lose, more to gain, daughters raised
Yesterday, glory days, adored and praised, ignored the hate
Addressed the fake, toured with Dre, tore a page from Jordan came
Destroyed the game before you came, enjoy your stay
Before it's gone away, but the more you claim that you're gonna point and aim
If it joined a gang, your shit isn't going to bang
You're just boring, lame and more of the same
You have an enormous chain, but a stormless brain
The most you can form is rain
Your shit is pointless, same as a scoreless game
So, bitch, quit lyin', you're denyin' like Mr. Porter's name (Haha)
Borderline bipolar disorder since my stroller
Eyes rollin' back in my skull like Eli Porter
Fire mortar (Brr) rounds, Ayatollah, every iota I load up
I owe to my motor mouth
This is my note to self
Sometimes you're gonna bomb
So you just might have to blow yourself up with no one's help
I just wrote it down in my book of rhymes
Preemo, take us out

[Outro]
Writin' in my book of rhymes
My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside
Writin' in my book of rhymes
My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside"

Yellow Brick Road

[Intro: Morris Casuto, Spiro Agnew, Randy Blazak & Eminem]
What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense, but not to constitute what this country at times calls (Yeah) their throwaway children
We seem to be approaching (C'mon!) an age of the gross (*Burp*)
We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' station and each—and each generation should do a little bit better

[Verse 1: Eminem]
All right, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressin' this issue, and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
Statements that's made on this tape and its whole origin of
The music that we all know and love, the music we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy
On the East Side of Detroit, crossin' 8 Mile into Warren
Into hick territory; I'd like to share a story
This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well-aware
That I don't belong here: you've made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stoppin' in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay, there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks

[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Bridge: Eminem]
I'd roam the streets so much they called me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 Mile and Van Dyke or steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark, to meet Kim had to walk
Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof
With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osborn, handin' out some flyers
We was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check us out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like, ""White boys don't know how to rhyme.""
I spit out a line and rhymed ""birthday"" with ""first place""
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
He said that Puma's the brand ‘cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew
Musta been true, because man, we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones, the Cool J Ice Lamb, suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X Clan debuted
Professor X (Vanglorious!)
""Exist in a state of red, black and green, with a key, sissies!""
Now with this bein' the new trend, we don't fit in
Crackas is out with Cactus Albums, blackness is in
African symbols and medallions represent Black Power
And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard
And Butter would go to the mall
With 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off
Not knowin' at all we was bein' laughed at
""You ain't even half black!
You ain't 'posed to have that, homie, let me grab that!
And that Flavor Flav clock, we gon' have to snatch that!""
All I remember is meetin' back at
Manix's basement, sayin' how we hate this
How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me, back in '89, me
And Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryin' to two-time me
And there was this black girl at our school, who thought I was cool
‘Cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
Ain't even gonna say it, plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts
And a pair of jugs, the bombest goddamn girl in our whole school
If I could pull her, not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired
I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard
Or spoke to the ""Ole Foolish Pride"" girl, but I've heard
People say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was: I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize, I was wrong
‘Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a—

[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

On Fire

[Intro]
(Haha, yeah, haha)
You know, critics, man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know, the one thing I notice about critics, man
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em

[Verse 1]
Augh, yesterday my dog died
I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said: ""Next time you blog, try to spit a flow.""
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up, so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flows tighter, hot-headed as Ghost Rider
Cold-hearted as Spider-Man throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Flo Rida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires, in a hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost
Shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off the Wizard of Oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him, and visit his dog

[Chorus]
(You're on fire)
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire)
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
(You're on fire)
You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire) Yeah
(You're on fire) Yuh

[Verse 2]
I just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses
If you mistook this for a song, look, this ain't a song
It's a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over, so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
Mr. Mathers is the man, yeah, I'm pissed
But I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it, I ain't playin', pull up in a van
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
""Vietnam vet"", I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him nine grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
Sayin' you sick, quit playin', you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air?
I ain't even talkin' to no one, 'cause ain't nobody there
And nobody will fuckin' test me
'Cause these hoes won't even dare
I'm wasting punchlines, but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Nah, don't waste it, save it, psycho—yeah
Plus you got to rewrite those lines
That you said about Michael's hair (Whoops!)

[Chorus]
(You're on fire)
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire)
Man, I'm so- I'm so hot
My motherfuckin' firetruck's on fire, homie
(You're on fire)
You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire) Yeah
Oh, shit (You're on fire)"

When the Music Stops

[Intro: Bizarre]
Music, reality: sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Psych!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, or show love, or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park—five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off
Lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shootin', I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch—let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap
Motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man, I hate this crap
This ain't rap, this is crazy, the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Ain't no gettin' rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried
The only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically
Arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessy
Got drunk then I finished him
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I'll murder you, I gauge and have me turn into
A mad man, Son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin'—you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I was happy havin' a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy
But it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dawg
And you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with their hands out
Checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink 'til your car spin
You think, ""Damn!"" when you slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder would they even call?
When the music stops

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol sippin' a can of Pennzoil
I'm revved up; who said what when lead bust?
Your head just explode with red stuff
I'm handcuffed, tossed in the paddy-wagon
Braggin' about how you shouted like a coward
Bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me
Just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war wit' your life
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroners like
You hype poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga, you're a goner at night (when the music stops)

[Verse 5: Proof]
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark, my dogs all bark like, ""Woof!""
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in like reindeer hooves
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
It's Hill Street—this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues, nigga
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop

[Verse 6: Bizarre]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
N.W.A said ""Fuck tha Police,"" now I'm in jail
'93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson—who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flyin' down Sunset, smokin' crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimy and gritty
Marilyn Manson–I dyed my hair blue and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm goin' in shock
I'm reachin' for the Glock, but the music stops"
"[Title]
Rabbit Run

[Verse]
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just put it all into all I spit
'Stead of always tryna swallow it
Instead of starin' at this wall and shit
While I sit, writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't call it, shit, all I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of Mom's alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic
I'm like a skillet bubblin' until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin' up
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well, I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peel the Dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps, yeah, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yeah, sit up, I'ma tell you who I be
I'ma make you hate me 'cause you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me
You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feelin' at that time
Yeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
It's just sometimes, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece
Of paper (*rip*) I'm desperate at my desk
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'
Fuck, I'm stumped up, oh wait, here comes somethin'
(*Crumples paper*) Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade?
Cyanide I spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it? I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter, bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a
Fuckin' boiling point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin, bitch, come get destroyed
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin'
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin' someone
By the way they're runnin', you would swear the law was comin'
It's now or never, and tonight is all or nothin'
""Momma, Jimmy keeps leavin' on us
He said he'd be back, he pinky promised, I don't think he's honest-""
I'll be back, baby I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me? Watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face
Bitch, I found my niche, you gon' hear my voice
'Til you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung
If I have half a chance, I'll grab it—Rabbit, run!"

Underground

[Intro]
A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know
But I do know I'm back now
Haha

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 1]
Dre, I'm down here, under the ground, dig me up!
Broken tibias, fibias, yeah, fix me up
Sixty sluts, all of them dyin' from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Wack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
(He can't say that!) Yes, he can
I just did, faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next-of-kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy
Especially when I flex again
And throw a fuckin' lesbian in wet cement
Faggoty, faggoty, faggoty! Raggedy Ann and Andy
No! Raggedy Andy and Andy
No, it can't be, it can't be—yes, it can be
The fuckin' Anti-Christ is back, Dante
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville, calamity, goddamn it
Insanity, pills, fanny pack filled with Xannies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk négligée, looky
Razor-ba-lades with me to make you ba-leed
Cases of Maybelline makeup lay on a table of weed
Slim Shady? Shit sounds like a fable to me
'Til he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 2]
Six semen samples, seventeen strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana, prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds
And Glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack-dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fuckin' Vicodin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lightning is strikin', it might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th
That means it's just a regular day (hah!)
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fuckin' lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missin' both legs and beggin' to stay

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 3]
Tell the critics I'm back and I'm comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable, cannibal, shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have 'em catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back into a trick-or-treat holiday
Have Michael Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a 40; stuck a suppository
Up his ass, and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lector a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in the fuckin' fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' Wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a Triple F.A.T. goose
Insanity, can it be vanity?
Where's the humanity in having a twisted fantasy
With an arm-and-leg amputee?
Straitjacket with a hundred and eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back
Then they latch it; cut your fuckin' head off
And ask where you're headed off to
Get it? ""Headed off to?"" Medic, this headache's awful!
This anesthetic's pathetic, so is this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Outro]
So, it wasn't a choice, it was ""I had to do this.""
And now I got 90 days clean
And uh, that's all I have to share, thanks
(Thanks for sharing, Brian
Is there anyone else who'd like to share this evening?)
Yeah, I got something to share:
""When you walked through the door you were queer to me
So come here, baby boy, just come here to me
You're a cock-boy, everybody wants you
You're gayer than you would ever claim to
I won't have to rape you
So, homie, lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down, lay down, lay down.""
Where's everybody going?
This always went over real big in Gay-A
Okay, wait, I got another one
""I just love condoms and lots of cum.""
No? Well, shit!"

Just the Two of Us

[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
Come on Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada musta runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kinda late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (yeah!)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch – it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 2]
See, honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
‘Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on timeout
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out!
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde: me and my daughter

[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 3]
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear  (Mama!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (yea)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free — whee! (woosh!)
There goes Mama, spwashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restrainin' order
No more stepdada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you wuv her (Mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Outro]
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your dada will always be there for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you — I love you, baby"

No Apologies

[Verse 1]
In my mind, I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
An arsenic writer, author with arth-r-itis
Carpal tunnel, Marshall with Start-Shit-Itis
Hardheaded and hotheaded, bullheaded and pigheaded
Dick-headed, a prick, a big headache
I'm sick, quick-witted; for every lyric spitted
There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it
So, quick—this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it
And it's not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling, I'll quit, so stop dwelling!
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
‘Cause I got jelly, like Beyoncé's potbelly
This is destiny; yes, money, I'm off running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

[Hook]
No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

[Verse 2]
My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxiation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating, haha!
Fuck, yeah, I'm a basket case
And I'll master this rap shit 'til my ass gets wasted
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain because of some fag's infatuation
.44 mag's a fascination
A taste for disaster, and if that's the case, then—

[Hook]
No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

[Verse 3]
This song isn't for you, it's for me
A true MC, it's what he'll do just to see
If he still has it and if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a—
Real MC, got you feelin' me
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree
As long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast If I ain't had this
Outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding, soaked in self-loathing
And mourning, so I'm warning you: Don't coax me
It's silly, I’m really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be—
Fooled; the press blows up this whole thing
It's stupid, they don't know, ‘cause they don't see
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talking 'bout these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of duking
They can suck my dick while I'm puking
And you, too, you can—

[Outro]
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies"

As the World Turns

[Chorus]
(I don't know) Yes, man
(Why this world keeps turning) As the world turns
('Round and 'round) We all experience things in life
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Trials and tribulations
(I don't know) That we all must go through
(Why this world keeps turning) When someone wants to test us
('Round and 'round) When someone tries our patience
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)

[Verse 1]
I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz, baby, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Yo, they never should've booted me outta reform school (Uh-uh)
Deformed fool, takin' a shit in the warm pool
'Til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said, ""It wasn't me, I got a twin""
Oh my God, it's you, not again (Ahh)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said, ""Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is Phys Ed""
Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she need a Slim Fast
(Who, me?) Yeah, bitch, you so big
You walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
(Well, I have never)
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (Rrrahh)
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground (Come here, bitch)
And took her up to the highest divin' board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly-flop

[Chorus]
('Cause I don't know) As the world turns
(Why this world keeps turning) These are the days of our lives
('Round and 'round) These are the things that we must go through
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Day by day

[Verse 2]
We drive around in million-dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source (Yo)
Hypochondriac, hangin' out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy, fat, white-trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said, ""What up? It's nice to meet ya"" (Hi)
""I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck
And I don't get paid 'til the first of next month (Sorry)
But if you'd care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies or no papers
Plus, I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money and don't try nothin' funny
'Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me""
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me (Stop)
With an uppercut, hit me with a basket of laundry (Ooh)
I fell through the glass doors, started causin' a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back, thank God I was smokin' crack
All day, and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her, but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen her bedroom door shut
""I know you're in there, bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now""
She said, ""Come in, it's unlocked""
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked, watchin' gay porn
She said, ""Come here, big boy, let's get acquainted""
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg, ""No, please let go""
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, ""Now, bitch, let's see who gets the best""
Stuffed that shit in, crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
Ow, ow (Come here, bitch)
Ow, ahh (Come here, take this mothafuckin' dick, bitch, come here)

[Chorus]
('Cause I don't know) And as we go along
(Why this world keeps turning) Throughout the days of our lives
('Round and 'round)
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
We all face small obstacles
(I don't know) And challenges everyday
(Why this world keeps turning) That we must go through
('Round and 'round) These are the things
That surround us through our atmosphere
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
(I don't know) Every day
(Why this world keeps turning) Every single day the world keeps turning
('Round and 'round) Keeps turning
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Keeps turning
(I don't know why this world keeps turning)"

This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now, homie, I say I run it, run it 'cause I'm in control
Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patrón
I have you feelin' a'ight, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin', shawty says she comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle; you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga, you front, you gon' get it, okay, now maybe I've said it
'Cause I want you to tridip, yeah, I be on that shidit
You should see when I'm stuntin', I flash the stones to be wantin'
Push the whip, see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I'm just doin' my thang, you know the Unit's the gang
I got my grimy Shady with me, you front, you'll have to get me
Off yo' ass, I pay the lawsuit and laugh
Haha! It's not a big deal, it's nothin' but some cash
Let's go!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know

I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped
We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight we ain't come in here to beef with nobody
We came to party: Banks, Ca$his, and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you izzask?
Come izzon, what kinda fizzuckin' quizzestion is that?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? I said, you know but you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin'; J.F.K
HK 'til your chest plate cave
I'ma ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Pussy, I'll survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad have called me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa Queens, mixed in with Ca$his creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' G?
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all-way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?
See…

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know but you actin' like you don't know
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
You know who this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath
Lloyd Banks, Ca$his, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50
It's a movement, you can't stop it
Talk of New York, Tony Yayo"

Die Alone

[Intro: Kobe]
Just so you don't die alone

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone
This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just left me here to die didn't you?
Why didn't you respond yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?

[Chorus: Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, ""Honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
I get bold like bowling balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I

[Chorus: Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, ""Honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

[Bridge: Kobe]
Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you?
Completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you?
Was you and me, once used to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I

[Chorus: Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, ""Honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone"

Desperation

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Girl, you give me writer's block, I'm at a loss for words
Uhh, my mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call a Roethlissplurge
You drive me bonkers, I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
Date 'cause I think I gave you power
When I gave you flowers in a vase
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Probably shoulda never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Shoulda been one of the first signs to cause alert
Man, we jumped in too fast
'Cause since then I just can't be apart from her
'Cause nobody's body's awesomer
I lust her and she loves me 'cause I'm popular
But you know this ain't love

[Chorus: Jamie N Commons and Eminem]
You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
(Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
('Cause I give in at the sight of her)
And I here I go again

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You were obviously oblivious to me
I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from
The beginning, now I'm in disbelief, I
Never knew that this could be such misery, ah
'Cause now you see nothing but me
And I don't see nothing but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are – super glued in
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Do anything individually, which is to cling on
Scared to be alone, can't specifically describe it
I just can't seem to give a reason
That's definitive, just need ya
Talkin' about I live and breathe ya
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither
Bitch, put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek
'Cause this ain't love

[Chorus: Jamie N Commons and Eminem]
You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
(Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
('Cause I give in at the sight of her)
And I here I go again

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just want you to myself
Don't wanna share you with no one else
""What the fuck you whisperin' for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
Games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a
Little more mentally to get the picture.""
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up
To the crib ever again, no Visa
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut
Guess what? (What?) The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were usin' me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh?
Yeah, toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood
I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said, ""The fuck with that!
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?""
She grabbed that fuckin' bat
And swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's
Right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal
Through the uprights

[Chorus: Jamie N Commons and Eminem]
You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
(Wants me to be that guy to her)
Lord, it's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
('Cause I give in at the sight of her)
Desperation (And I here I go again)"

Need Me

[Verse 1: P!nk]
You're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

[Chorus: P!nk]
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

[Verse 2: P!nk & Eminem]
Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

[Chorus: P!nk]
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Startin' to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults, so there's no excuse
For the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, mothafucker!
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile
Makin' an excuse for us to act it out
She's just actin' out with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie
Then I breathe a sigh of relief, I don't believe in
Goin' to bed mad, I keep on tryin'
To make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad? I'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'Cause I literally feel like you could die if ever should I
Leave you for good and never would I
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble, but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you—what is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apart
You're usin' my heart for a dartboard
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake
But this one's perfect, 'cause I'm—

[Chorus: P!nk]
I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me"

W.T.P.

[Intro]
Yeah! Oh! Get up (Where my trash at?)
I said, get up
You know what happens when I'm around, man
Woo! Let's go
Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we ain’t stoppin' until we see the morning sun
So give us room to do our thing 'cause we ain’t come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone

[Verse 1]
Man, first of all; I’m a boss, I just want to get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it’s a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray-painted doors
With the flames on ‘em, Michigan plates, and my name's on ‘em
Baby, Shady’s here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain’t stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him?
'Cause you won’t do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There’s a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance?
She’s got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call ‘em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps down
And show this hussy who’s the man now get amped, dance

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (White trash party)
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party (White trash party)

[Verse 2]
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care, like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead
And tomorrow I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
I'm mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like I’m hollering ""Die Santa""
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul
And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis
But I’m not throwin' ones, fives, 10's, or even 20's
I’m throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny’s from the North, East, and West
But when it comes to them trailers in them South parks
Muffle it, 'cause, homie, that hood’s tighter than Kenny’s
So, ladies, if your belly button’s not an innie, then I’m outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
Come on

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (White trash party)
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party (White trash party)

[Bridge]
Now whether you’re black, white, or purple, if you’re misunderstood
But you don’t give a fuck, you ain’t doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you’re up to evil and you’re no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your hood

[Verse 3]
Now honey, don’t let them pricks trip, we should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot, 'cause, girl—I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
And make a five-seater, I’ll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain’t like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don’t need a tank top to be a wife beater
I’ll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I’ll tell you now, I’m so raw, I still need to unthaw
You feel me, y'all? I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that’s against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party (White trash party)"

Say Goodbye Hollywood

[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
And just leave, how come I couldn't see this shit myself?
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me; the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
I'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around, saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground
So for now—

[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 2]
Bury my face in comic books, ‘cause I don't wanna look
At nothing, this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol, I would
And end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are pilin' all at once
‘Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood ‘cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps
Of my dad ‘cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had
Was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass
Man, if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em I'm

[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life, this is sick
""Publicity stunt"" my ass, ""conceal"" my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp
On the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no-one to seein'
Everything blow up, and all you did was just grow up emceein'
It's fuckin' crazy, ‘cause all I wanted was to give Hailie
The life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'

Goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (Goodbye)
Please don't cry for me (It's been real)
When I'm gone for good (This shit is not for me)
So goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (I'm not a fuckin' star)
Please don't cry for me (No way)
When I'm gone for good (I'm goin' back home)"

They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me?
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
Doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to, but I do
Yeah, I say it now when you can't hear me
What the fuck good does that do me now?
But somehow I know you're near me in presence
Oh, I went and dropped some presents off for Easter
To them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
Minds a little, and dog, you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now—Jesus!
And everyone else is just tryin' to pick up the pieces
Man, how could you touch so many fuckin' lives and just leave us?
They say grievance has a way of affectin' everyone different
If it's true, how the fuck I'm s'posed to get over you?
Difficult as it sounds

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
Doody, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', ""Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!""
Until we meet again, Doody

[Verse 2: Eminem]
""Doody,"" that's what we'd call each other
I don't know where it came from
But it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's skin colors
'Til one day we was walkin' up the block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees, I was catchin' a sunburn
Tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
I'm moanin', I just wanna get home and
I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like, ""You're gonna fry,"" you're like, ""No, I won't
I'm black, stupid! And black people they got melatonin
In their skin—we don’t burn,"" meanwhile my face is glowin'
And I feel like I'm on fire
And the entire time you're just laughin' at me
And snappin' at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way, them Playboy rings my mother stole from you
Well, Nate finally got 'em back, shit
It must've been at least 16 years ago
Well, I put 'em in your cask—oww
Movin' past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City, Motown, hip hop vet
Hip Hop Shop, dreads, it don't stop there
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
Doody, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', ""Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!""
Until we meet again, Doody

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And this might sound a little strange but I'ma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding
And I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all me and D12 we feel like ""Fuck rap!""
It feels like our general just fuckin' died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
Our two-ways are in the trash
So some cats will have to find a new way
And I know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressin' on
Don't ever give up the dream, dog, I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you brought people together
Who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker, Doody
I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin'
If it had to happen, it had to happen
Believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to throw them 'bows back on Dresden
From eggin' cars to paintballin', gettin' arrested
To sittin' across from each other in cells, laughin' and jestin'
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court, so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
Me, you and… what's his face? I forgot his fuckin' name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
And that’s on Hailie Jade, Whitney Laine and Alaina’s name
I let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
In the air for you and pour some liquor out
With Obie in the parking lot of 54 just before
We were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
Difficult as it sounds

[Outro: Obie Trice]
Doody!"

So Bad

[Intro]
Yeah, haha, you feel that, baby?
Yeah, I feel it too, damn
(I'm so bad, I'm so good that I’m so bad)
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
(I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had)
You see, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?
('Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again)

[Verse 1]
I’m the American Dream
I’m the definition of white trash ballin’
I’m right back on 'em with a *err-chick-err, chicka-chick*
I can't call it, same shit, different toilet
Oh, you got a nice ass, darling
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin'? You take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady’s origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I must've got my pimpin' genes from him
The way he left my momma
I'm a rolling stone, just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby, I'll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as
Me, I'm as calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knees, his legs, and his arms
I'm a superstar, girl, I'm ready for you, mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, I'm so good that I’m so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, I'm so good that I’m so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Verse 2]
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo
First I'll kiss your navel, work my way down
Baby, you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find somethin' more stable
I told you I ain't foolin' from the gate
This ain't the first day of April
But thank you for stayin', April
I'ma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake Gs
Skip over the ""huggy bear,"" and all the ""kissy face,"" please
Initiate phase three, missy, now service me
Take another shot of Jäger, shakin' so nervously
Take your time, baby, oh, you’re the bomb, baby
Oh, you’re doing that even better than your mom, lady
I told you why I’m Shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?
Relax, woman, you know that I’m only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit ya
I think you’re finally startin' to get the picture, I’m just...

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Bridge]
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
'Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh

[Verse 3]
I got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
The feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad, you're
Sweatin', but if I’m what you wanted
Why’d you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl, don't be so frantic, I’m just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
You can’t ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let’s get to camcordin'
Damn, shawty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back
And throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blind that
You couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a line-up
So stop at the store, pick a pint up
Let's get the pineapple Schnapps going, no one will knock
'Cause I'ma hang a sign up saying ""Don't Disturb""
Shawty, I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Bridge]
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
'Cause I am on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

Same Song & Dance

[Intro]
Yeah
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it, man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight, yo

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
The whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly bugging you non-stop
I walk up on ya, “Well, hello Tonya”
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say, ""Exact opposites attract""
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
Come on

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Verse 2]
The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four-to-six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
""Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt!
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done""
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With 66 inches of extension cord

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Verse 3]
My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Climb the gate, and ring the bell like, ""Hello, my love
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
Now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do""

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Outro]
Same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
Same song and dance
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
Same song and dance
Yeah
Same song and dance
I know
Same song and dance"

[Intro: Eminem & Lesley Gore]
You don't own me
Nah, man—not quite finished yet
I'm not just one of your many toys
Ha-ha, woo!

[Verse 1: Eminem & Lesley Gore]
Girl, I think you just might've tried to pull a motherfuckin' fast one, I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade? Tryna play games? See this saw blade?
See this silhouette of a stalker in your walkway? Better cooperate
Or get sauteed and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
MC's get so quiet you can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin and run over kids, women, and men
Vrinn-vrinn!—Motor so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin'? Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny? Shit, if I think a penny's pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me; Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Catch an Eskimo by his toe while he's tryna roll a snowball (You don't own me)
But don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers, better let him go, y'all (I'm not just one of your many toys)
'Cause

[Chorus: Eminem & Lesley Gore]
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Get up, baby, get a move on like a U-Haul, you can rack your brain
Like pool balls; you won't ever think of this shit—yeah, honey, you called?
Well, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it; Evil—I see
Hear, and speak it—Lady, put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every motherfuckin'
Chicken 'fore it hatches 'cause you can bet your ass that we gonna get it crackin'
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin', get your brains bashed in
So bad, you will have Kurt Cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable, and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flagpole
With Elton, see if he's cool with it, don't stand there and look stupid
At me, bitch, I ain't in the mood for this shit, get my dick, Google it
'Til it pops up! Y'all are so motherfuckin' full of shit that you're stopped up
Me, I'm always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth 'til your speakers crap out (*fart*) Huh, what?
Girl, you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette (Chig-chigga-ret-ret)
But you won't get a hot fudge sundae from me so do not strut
My way, slut, because—

[Chorus: Eminem & Lesley Gore]
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And now that I got your panties in a bunch and your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me, ""What the fuck for?""
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore, I know you want more
Bitch, it's time to put the math back into Mathers 'cause I'm a fuckin' problem—run, boy!
Every flow, got it mastered so every last word that you fuckin' fags heard
Comes straight from the fish's ass, yeah, in other words, I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank—yeah, still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse, I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous
Fuck an animal, I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now—can you, ho?
“Shady, I don't understand your flow” — Understand my flow? Bitch, I flow
Like Troy Polamalu's hair, boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy
I'm raw, you ain't even medium-rare, stay the fuck outta my hair, boy
You can look, you can stare, and point, but you can't touch, I'm too clairvoyant
I don't get it, man, is there a void? All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well, bitch, I'm back with some shit for that ass and your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids
And remember, boys—

[Chorus: Eminem & Lesley Gore]
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go

[Outro: Eminem]
Thank you for coming out
I hope you enjoyed the show
'Til next time (Ha-ha)
Peace (Peace, peace)"

You’re Never Over

[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

[Verse 1]
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me, clowns
That means ""suicide,"" homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talkin' awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world, when you're the only one
With the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
'Member that when they get to doggin' you boy, homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I'm not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, Obi
I'm moppin' the floors with 'em, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on
Droppin' the torch and it won't be long 'til this sport is O-V-
-E-R, just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors and no, we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween, but we'll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here, so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P, let me guide you through the smoke, G
If only I wasn't travelin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me

[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

[Post-Chorus]
And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And I miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no

[Verse 2]
For you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the ""dyna"" in ""mite""
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I can do right now, Doody, for you is to rep
So I'm gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin' your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
'Cause the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothin' that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and I bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage, I've been patiently watchin'
This game, pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof, you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on their asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
I never woulda came in this game, I'm goin' insane without you
Matter fact, it was just the other night had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, ""Naw, Doody, you're not!""; layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it; soon as you said, ""Think of Hailie"" I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies; and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord, I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you, Doody

[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

[Post-Chorus]
And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And I miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no"

Amityville

[Intro: Eminem]
(Kill, kill, kill)
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum... dum
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, duh-da-da-da-da
(Kill, kill, kill)
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum... dum
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, dumm
(Kill, kill, kill)

[Chorus: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this

[Chorus: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 2: Bizarre & Eminem]
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwin' up in the urinal
(You fuckin' homo!) That's what I said at my dad's funeral

[Chorus: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still (Still)
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit, he gets killed (Killed)
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville (Ville)
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!)
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still (Still)
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill (Hill)
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot (Shoot)
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with 'em too (Too)
That's the mentality here (Here), that's the reality here (Here)
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here? (Huh?)
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here? (Here)
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year? (Year)
'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen (Happen), when a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you
And your family in it; goddammit, he meant it when he told you

[Chorus: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

I’m Shady

[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed ""Fuck the world""
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh-huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)
I don't want to just die a normal death
I wanna be killed twice (Uh-huh)
I just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife said this the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me, help me)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
(Stay in school)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck-you letter

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo, I'll listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Ahh, that shit is wack)
Six months later, you'll hear your lyrics on my shit
(That's my shit)
People don't buy shit no more, they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number-one club hit
(Yup, uh-huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (Uh-huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid mothafuckas think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed (Uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (Yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitching
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS-infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Outro]
I told you I was Shady (Yup)
Y'all didn't wanna believe me (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
I'm Shady
And that's my name"

Mosh

[Intro]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands (People)
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all (It feels so good to be back)
(Mosh with me now)

[Verse 1]
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as ""I'ma whip someone's ass""
And if you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, movin' past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubber Band Man, yeah, he just snaps back

[Chorus]
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Verse 2]
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no, we say yeah, They tell us stop, we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just

[Chorus]
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Verse 3]
Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Moshpits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryna tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six
'Teen million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil
We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out, and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why
'Cause I told you to fight

[Chorus]
So come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Outro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our president for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator
Can you guys hear us?"

The Kids

[Intro]
And everyone should get along
Okay, children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day: his name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that! (Shut up!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got AIDS!)
Good luck, Mr. Shady!

[Verse 1]
Hi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi, Bob (""Hi, Bob!"")
Bob's thirty and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, ""Knock it off!""
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it—it's bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Ask him, man)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck, no! You ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy—it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, or it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach: twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (Blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!""
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Don't smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (But umm…)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes, you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Outro]
Come on, children, clap along! (Shut up!)
Sing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Come on, clap along
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! Goddamn it!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny!)
(Uh, the fart button's on) (*fart*) (Ew, ahh!)
La la la (So fucked up right now)"

Bully

[Intro]
Yo, check it out
It's fucked up
'Cause I don't see either one of us budging

[Verse 1]
""I'm withholdin' my anger though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist that he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect""
That's what he says to himself as he uses his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin' things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy, it just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world so he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into a rage
And it's destroyin' him slowly 'cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself, he has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's actin' like a bully so he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
And he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared

[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
And I know it must be fuckin' wit' you emotionally

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not tryin' to make no more enemies, no more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers there just are
They just keep houndin' at me now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
But his ass is such a puppet, Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv on a string and Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough and Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks so you ain't takin' out shit
And, dawg, you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist you fucked when you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch

[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
You must be takin' too much E

[Verse 3]
Now what bothers me the most about hip-hop is we're so close
To pickin' up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J, Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah
It's like a never-ending cycle that just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fuckin' hard
And I'm not excludin' myself 'cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men, we learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck about Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feedin' him pills so if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talkin' to you straight if the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap, I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name

[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
Irvine, get your boy off of that E

[Outro]
Get at me, dawg
Holla"

Fine Line

[Verse 1]
Another day, another hotel, the inside of it is nice though, oh well
This is my life so as I go and try on clothes for tonight's show
To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because all's I ever did
Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
'Cause I will say some ol' inspirational shit in a real way
But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit
In the world and tell it to suck on the dick, 'cause I still make fun
Of a sitch someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense
I'm fuckin' relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence
It's a balance beam, if I seem unbalanced, it's challenging
When my conscience allows me to think the most foulest
Childish things without even blinking, without even thinkin' about
All the stinkin' amounts of people that seems to be reachin'
But the crowds, they're screaming
And The Palace sold out this evening
But now it's lay me down to sleep
And is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?
Is it greed? And do I take more than I need?
When I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin'
'Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even

[Hook: Luis Resto]
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

[Verse 2]
So a martyr is how I paint myself
And through my harrowin' ordeals I’m so vain I want my respect
But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
'Til I sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
'Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights
Yeah, it's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might
Say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears
'Cause this ice layer I skate on's a nice way of putting it
But I like stayin' feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit from
And this house, is quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, it's nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song
Vicious cycle ain't it, then wonder why I stay famous
I keep walkin' the line, this goldfish bowl gets old
But especially when you don’t know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
'Cause you don't even know anymore
If you got the soul of a soldier, or you sold your soul

[Hook: Luis Resto]
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

[Bridge]
And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back to me

[Verse 3]
I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin', hate even going outside
It sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimer's
Long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time
'Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the time
When I slept on the floor at The Outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'll, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I—

[Hook: Luis Resto]
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

My Syllables

[Intro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It’s about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and A-B-C it
Then so be it, ‘cause nowadays, these kids just
Don’t give a shit 'bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat, and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playing them hits
""Oh, this my jam! This my shit!
We don't know a word to a verse, all we know is the chorus
‘Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the song's ginormous, the whole formula’s switched
‘Cause we don’t know anymore what are hits""
Is it the beat? Is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When thirteen-year-olds control the remotes?
And Ashlee's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-pha-sis on our syl-la-la-bles

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc
Is in the beat, then I’m gon' feature Em and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro'
‘Cause everywhere I go they love the ""bling-bling"" flow
Bang-bang, look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing’ cost your man a lot of dough (Oh)
The fuck am I bustin' my brain fo'?
It's just the way the game go and, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow? You bought the shit
I guess you to blame, too, I just found an angle (Hahaha)
No more reality flow
I’m tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the MAC-11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist, tell her we in press heaven (Haha)
No one gives a shit except
Some kids that just got into sex on the Internet
So you want the chatroom or the house in Malibu?
Em, your emphasis is on the wrong syl-la-la-ble

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
They said thirty's the new twenty, funny
Must mean forty's the new thirty, interesting
'Cause ever since then, it's been, in a sense, an extension
For veteran rappers that are better than half of
The shit coming out right now, it's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
JAY said it’s his last, then 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops, what do we got then?
So now our whole camps is running around
Scrambling over what to do
Gambling every time we put a record out
Just lookin' for that hook (Wait, Dre, look!)

[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be
‘Cause, shorty, you love me
And I love you too
And I promise I’ll be true to you

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Go shawty, it's your birthday (Woo)
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
And run G for days, you should see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked 'round the globe
I'm sick right into shows, ridin' on lolos (Yeah)
Puffin' on coco, my bitch in Manolos
Don’t fuck with the dodos, that's slang for dumb hoes (Oh)
I'm playin', I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked, loc
It's not a game, me, B, I ain't playin', beat behind me playin'
So you don't hear anyway, you don’t hear what I’m sayin'
Me fin-nini-na, fee-fi-fididee-yay
Just give me my check and I’ll be on my way
Sunny, bunny, money and funny
You ain't even listening, and I just took your money (Ha)

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
There once was a time everywhere you turned ('Where you turned)
Shady-Aftermath was all you heard
But they say 50 sang too much, and Em got soft (Got soft)
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off (Woo!)
Well, fuck the fuck-offs! All y'all eat salt
Be mad, we back, fresh up outta the vault
Oh! New syl-la-la-bles, eat ball, you fuck-offs
Your house, your bitch, I'm getting sucked off
East, South, Midwest, even up North
Falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I’m runnin' past while y'all walk

[Verse 6: Cashis]
Shady made me for bringin' it back
'Fore the history of rap is gone with a snap
A snare and a clap, what happened to just spittin'
'Bout livin' in the motherfuckin' city you at?
In the grimiest condition, I breathe in drama
King Mathers and Cash—me—that's free karma
I'm everything, anything you can never be
It's a hidden rhyme of the month deep in the beef
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine (Yeah)
No rest contest, contract to sign
By blood, I'm in this squad for life
Hear about out my windpipes, and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I’m crazy, renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I’m Rosemary’s baby, I want you to hate me

[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be
‘Cause, shorty, you love me
And I love you too
And I promise I’ll be true to you

[Outro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
A hot-hot-hot beat and a catchy hook
A hot-hot-hot beat and a catchy hook
Nobody gives a damn about them syllables
Syl-la-la-bles, whatever they are
I don't care if you gotta rhyme ""schmoe,"" ""mo,"" ""Joe,"" ""toe,"" and ""glow""
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some"

Drips

[Intro: Eminem & Obie Trice]
Obie, yo
I'm sick
Damn, you straight, dog?

[Chorus: Eminem & Obie Trice]
That's why I ain't got no time (I think I got chlamydia)
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches (Bitch!) on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick (That bitch!)
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 1: Obie]
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk (Damn!)
I had a bag of the skunk, won in last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaner's
Fucked me good, you shoulda seen this
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable (Shit!)
French roll stylin', body like a stallion
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debatin' on a fuck or do I wanna be her nigga?
Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits (Damn!)
Sippin' on that fine shit I ain't used to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like takin' hoes' money, but that's another story
For surely pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop in Juice (C'mere)
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock
In that spot hotter than the hottest block
""Don't stop!""—response I got when I was knockin' it
Clock's steady tickin', kinky finger lickin'
And can on, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga like a slave owner (Yeah)
When I dropped off my outfit she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch (C'mere), the last part of sex
I bust a fat-ass nut, then I woke up next (Holy)
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here? (Shit!) This bitch evaporated
Pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated, 'cause my dick was unprotected (Damn!)
And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit (Fuck!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin'
Someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw her
Off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
Though what's she shovin' me for? (Bitch!) Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man, I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?
She's havin' another baby in a month and it's yours
And you found it isn't, 'cause this bitch has been visitin' someone else
And suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back to Michigan
Now the plot is thickenin' worse
‘Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they told you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out, lookin' like Dennis the Menace (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS (Sorry)
He ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it (Sorry)
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
When you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo
'Cause you love her, you never would expect that blow
Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringin' me home diseases, swingin' from Obie's penis
She's so deceivin', shit, this ho's a genius, she G'd us

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Outro: Eminem & Obie Trice]
I'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches!
Fuck 'em all!
Get money, Shady Records
Ha, whoa!
Obie Trice! Eminem, motherfucker!
New millennium shit, yeah
Turn this shit off, man
Turn this shit the fuck—"

Don’t Front

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Used to get bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spittin' like vintage Pac
Demented, demonic, sinister
Ever since the Doc' replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just about to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shockin' image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
‘Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxin' critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me broccoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at
This and put emphasis on the ""dope""
So when names come up, in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere
When it fires and I unload, my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Beggin' my mom for K-Mart MacGregors
‘Cause those were new, St. Vincent de Paul
Those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adiós, I did it
They said I was a gimmick
Now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go startin' no argument
‘Cause you know I'll win it
Name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Rest in peace to Big Proof
You was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowin' through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fuckin' tone that you speak
Feel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league
On my motherfuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete
And I've never been known to retreat
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say ""Bon appétit!""
‘Cause I don't know what to eat
Fuckin' microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
‘Cause I rhyme like I'm still tryna get signed
Up in the Ebony Show-case
With Denaun screamin' ""Who the fuck passed you the mic?""
Never asked you to like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first
‘Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills crackin'
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down!
‘Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around, so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbin' it in and holdin' some grudge now? But don't front

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers, ‘cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak, windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump in tonight
‘Cause I'm hyper or somethin'
Needin' someone or somethin' is lightin'
This fire under me, it's breathin' new life
It's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke were so long ago
I lost all concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fuckin' nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm havin' a stroke of genius—Elizabeth, I'm comin' to you, honey
From boy to man
And still make a whore moan, like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man
Don't group me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense
Precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers comin' up
That are nutty with the flow, but convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's as good with the fuckin' mincing of words
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Who's as mentally disturbed
You might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin bein' Indian burned
Hah, bitch, there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served, if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words
Don't front

[Outro: Buckshot]
You know I got you open kid, stop frontin'
You know I got you open, Word Life..."

Despicable

[Intro]
Ugh, ha (Da-na na-na-na)
Nah, fuck an intro, man, let's just go (Yeah!)

[Verse]
I come around like what goes around
What goes up must come down
Anyone who comes up must go down
Might as well go for the gusto now
Better not let up, better not let them breathe
Last shot, give it all you got
Try to turn me down, bitch
Get fucked with a volume knob, fuck all you snobs
Hoes, I hope all you rot
Two bottles of Lubriderm and a box of condoms
Is that all you brought?
And you want a ménage à trois, you twats?
Fuck that, I'd rather turn this club to a barroom brawl
Get rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
Like a leech stuck in a vacuum, y'all
Ain't nothing but a whole lot of sucking going on in rap
Yeah, but I'm home
Bad to the bone, back in the zone
Let him alone, you don't want to go eggin' him on
It'll never be my chair that you own
Crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain
No oxygen—other words, there's no heir to the throne
When I die so does hip-hop
Hitchcock of the shit, bitch, ask Doc
Got it ziplocked in a bag
You fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high-top
Keep bloggin' while I mind-boggle
And I zone like I'm in the twilight, dog
Get off my bone, this is my mic, doggone it
I like hoggin' it
Flows so wet, I'ma take this beat tobogganing
I'm waterloggin' it—I'm sogging it
Pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
Suplexing it on cement
Like I'm on some ""Straight Outta Compton"" shit
Take this dick and chomp on it
I'm so bad I can bitchslap a backhanded compliment
Jackass, eat a donkey dick
The game I just about conquered it
Like Donkey Kong, I'm bonkers, bitch
I'm the king of this honkey shit
I reign supreme in this honkey shit
No sense screaming and arguing
Makes no difference whether a Benz or a Bentley
Or a Bimmer's the car you in
You think you ball? Well, I palm it
I throw up bombs when I vomit
Boy, I throw down in the kitchen
Might hit your mom with my omelette
But you got egg on your face
Now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
Bitch, I'm as batshit as Ozzy
It's obvious, you can tell right off the bat
No pun intended, but come any closer, I'll bite off your head
Tryna give me the finger's kinda like giving a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I'll catch a fly in that bitch, you think you fly, you just food
I give as much of a flying fuck as that Superman dude
Guess I just do what you can't do
And make you look stupid and bamboozled
Confused as usual and you can get whipped
She can open a can, too
But you better hope you can handle the heat
Or stay the fuck outta Hell's Kitchen
I came to cockblock like a square fucking male chicken
Yeah, it's Shady, slut, the rest can suck on that big one
'Cause I'm as despicable as Daffy Duck when I'm spittin'

Medicine Ball

Oh my goodness, what have I done?
Oh no, I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York, right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said, nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section, I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten then twice shy, well lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities, why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try, Lester?
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter, then I guess I'll
Dig her fetus out with a wire hanger, then digest her

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Verse 2]
All my Westside bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up
Man, I think that he just fell off the deep end, sure enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man, you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls, so you know who did it
You know you with it, girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole, you kiddin'?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy-gluin' Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that, man, who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick, unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Verse 3]
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man? Grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man, they don't understand, I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me
Like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words, jeez
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please?
""Eminem, I'm coming to kill you (inhale)
Always hated you, and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume (inhale)
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far (inhale)
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
Every day I hate you more and more, throw down the cardboard
Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore""

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?

In time (Everything's all fucked up)
I'm discombobulated, discombobulated
Miss, you ovulating? Wait, I didn't mean to
Piss you off, my lady, what I really meant to say is
It goes a little something like this

[Verse 1]
Soon as I'm through with the Unisom I'ma hit the snooze alarm
Before I lose my mind, who am I gonna use it on?
Utilizing this tool, I will execute a line
Like what I tried to do one time in my youth when I euthanized
My poodle in junior high, used to hide in my room and fly
To the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies
Then Proof, Denaun
Eye-Kyu and I would climb in that hooptie to ride to 'Drew's and rhyme
Bodied Saint Andrew's Hall too many times to count
Before I tear up The Shelter, give my dawgs a pound
Now I'm 'bout to treat all of you rappers' noggins how
Dre does every time he goes back to Compton now
'Cause every so often I'll visit my old stomping grounds
And Doc's in the house, so you know the bong is out
Room is spinning like nine-hundred-thousand miles an hour
Forgot what I'm talkin' 'bout, fuck, I'm discombobulated

[Chorus]
Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I comin' or goin'? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So, baby, please, take off your clothes
(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!), yeah

[Verse 2]
Just flew the coop, the cops are in hot pursuit
But the day they catch me is the day 50'll call a truce
And quash the feud with him and Ja and Ja'll actually spit a bar
That's not from a Dr. Seuss book and they'll start a group (Haha)
Fuck it, I'm a kook, I know I got a screw
And a couple of marbles loose, brain is like ramen soup
Shout to Trugoy, gotta give a De La salute
'Cause my noodle's in a knot, call it pasta noose (Posdnuos, yeah)
Wizard of ah's (Oz) and ooh's

Who also used to sound like Nas on ""Live at the Barbeque""
Now I got the juice, wouldn't beef if I was you
Like, au jus, but beef, if like
""I was you,"" but, like, ah, fuck you (Man)
Long as I got these walls and these hallways I'm always
Have someone to argue with, I'm just all twisted, I'm discombobulated, man

[Chorus]
Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I comin' or goin'? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So, baby, please, take off your clothes
(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!)

[Verse 3]
I'm at my best when I'm at my worst
And for that I'm blessed, so every time I rap I curse
And that's why press, I usually get attacked by first
They're at my neck like motherfucking vampires
So critics si-day I si-day the same shi-dit, I'm always degrading, little bi-ditch
Well, fi-duck 'em, they can si-duck my di-dick when I'm taking a shi-dit
Mid-y middle fid-inger is ex-tid-ended now, should I tell 'em where to put it?
I'm si-do fed up with it, they ask me dumb shi-dit
So I act like I'm on a kayak with my back to Niagara
No life jacket, man, I had like six psychiatrists, scientists
Misdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause I asked 'em, ""Why is it
My eye itches?"" so they gave me some diet tips
And Viagra with side effects, I might end up growing spiderwebs
In my head and dying a horrifying death, on my final breath
I will tell you, apply your lips to my dick, it's one size that fits
I just took an AIDS test and the doctor said to think positive, what the fuck?

[Chorus]
Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I comin' or goin'? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no

Crazy in Love

[Intro: Heart (Sampled)]
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me, baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane, I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act
Like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
What's that that's attractin' us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it, you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby
Because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24, but you're plenty more ma-ture
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy, sexy, cool, chill
And you play your position, you never step outta line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept outta mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time
I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Hook: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 2]
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony is you rely on me
As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me, you're the air I breathe I believe
If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin' for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Hook: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you"

Spend Some Time

[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road
And now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
'Til more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire and—

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked, I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that? Who would'a even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life-altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)

[Interlude: Stat Quo]
Ha, ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is, ""Fuck a bitch!""
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this
Shawty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who could've predicted to know
Your trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: ""Do I love these hoes?"" — Nope!

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
(Yeah) Em introduced us: ""50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50""
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, ""You have very nice lips.""
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit? (Ha-ha!)

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"

Hello

[Intro]
Hello (Hello)
Allow me to introduce myself (Myself)
My name is Shady
It's so nice to meet you (It's so nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (Long time)
I'm sorry I've been away so long (So long)
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you (I never meant to leave you)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You see that chick in the gym, checking me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man, I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah, open sesame mouth
Down the hatch, and the feeling you can't match it
I rat-tat-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like forty-some Xanaxes
Shorty come back, I'm tryna score me some lap dances
I'm 'bout to relapse, so baby pour me some Jack Daniel's
Formula 44D and 40's with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back at ya

[Chorus 1]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
And are you menstruating, baby?
My little friend's waiting to say hello
The way your titties are wigglin'
And your booty's shakin' like jello
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello, yeah

[Verse 2]
My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man, people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra-curriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
Fifty-one people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me, hun, but what is your name, Vivian?
I woke up next to you naked, and uh, did we, um?
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy, hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run
Like Speedy Gon-zales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's, I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum

[Chorus 2]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
Do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

[Verse 3]
Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
Word-word, chk-word-word, chk-word, chk-chk-word
I second that and I third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free, hundred bucks for these Percodans
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin' him
Tirelessly on the phone trying to rustle up
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumbling back
Slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it, I'm back!

[Chorus 2]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
Do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

[Outro]
And so I'm saying, hello! (Hello)
Allow me to introduce myself (Myself)
My name is Shady
It's so nice to meet you (It's so nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (Long time)
I'm sorry I've been away so long (So long)
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you (I never meant to leave you)
Yeah, it's like starting over
Clean slate, hah"

These Demons

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, you know what? (Loud Pack)
Haters are funny, man (Haha)
It's like, you're gonna hate it no matter what it is
Yet you still click on it (Zombie on the track), huh, yeah

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you to change, but don't change (Yeah)
I want you to grow up, but don't age
I want the rage, but don't get too angry
I want the new, but old Shady
I want you to say what they won't say (Yeah)
Just don't go too far, but go cray
I want you to almost lose it, man
They keep movin' the goalpost, don't they?
So let's cut to the chase like OJ
In his Bronco goin' up the roadway (Skrrt)
And get off my dick
If I said my balls were yarn, you bitches would crochet (Haha)
All I ever wanted's a rope chain
From the day I saw Cool J on Soul Train
Now I got that Kangol, two cables (Haha)
One yellow and white gold plated
Just to let 'em know I made it

[Chorus: MAJ & Eminem]
I told my dawgs we gon' get right in a year (Yeah), yeah, yeah
What did it cost? Now I get gone in the Lear (Woo), yeah, yeah
Still have all these demons comin' for my neck, yeah, yeah
I ain't never comin' down, yeah, yeah (Yo)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
This pandemic got us in a recession
We need to reopen America (What?)
Black people dyin', they want equal rights
White people wanna get haircuts (Haha)
Some people protest, some people riot (What?)
But we ain't never escapin' this virus (Nah)
'Til the cops that are racially biased (What?)
We no longer enable these liars
You get 'em on tape, they stick to a story
Like Spider-Man crawlin' upside of a wall and (Yeah)
Some are just unabiding as lawmen (Yeah)
Like Garrett Rolfe and like Derek Chauvin (Yup)
No cap, still riding with Colin (Yup)
Though some people don't like me at all and (Yeah)
Some are like (Summer like) bees to flowers (Why?)
'Cause some people find me appalling (A pollen, haha)
Ooh, I say a line, people are outraged (Oh no)
The press slams me again (Yeah), people ain't having it nowadays
Then give an album that I put out in, like, 2000 you griped about praise
But I wake up every day even more caked up than the makeup on your clown face
And I laid my foundation, and

[Chorus: MAJ & Eminem]
I told my dawgs we gon' get right in a year, yeah, yeah
What did it cost? Now I get gone in the Lear, yeah, yeah
Still have all these demons comin' for my neck, yeah, yeah
I ain't never comin' down (Yeah), yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I got a question (What?)
What rhymes with pariah?
(I don't know) Mm, tsk, uh, LEGO? (Oh shit)
You just bit into the lit end of the wick
Shit, I meant, shit end of the stick
I'm addicted to friction and mischief
It's like your bitch's midriff, shit gets my dick stiff as a stick shift
Dick as in Cheney, drip as in saline
They bring my name up just to get ratings
It's like trying to choose between Bizzy, Layzie, or Wish against Krayzie
'Cause I got a bone to pick and Slim Shady (Slim Shady)
Will thug (Thug) and harm any (Harmony)
Who attempt to diss Hailie (Hailie)
Bitch, I will go in like it's raining
And I get canceled like once a day (Yeah)
Why would I go? It's more fun to stay (Ah)
You get me to leave? There's no fuckin' way
I got a better chance of fuckin' Young M.A. (Ooh)
Ooh, sounds like I'm zoning
So me sayin' I'm out, nice to know me
Is like askin' me where my shin is
It's down right bologna (Below knee, haha)
Uh, oh, but we can play hide the salami (Yeah)
If your gal'd like to blow me (Yup)
My wave is like a tsunami (Yup)
These flows you're still tryna wrap your head around like you're a swami (Ha)
Just call me the mic kamikaze with Mike Zombie and I'ma just keep bombing (Woo)
'Cause the game is mine like an IED (Yeah)
If they ever do cancel me like Live PD
Said I'm takin' some of you with me if I'm leaving (Brr)
It's time to murder you now, side B, B
I might be D to the fuckin' I-Z-Z
Y from rappin' circles around these hoes
Just like girdles and every word from my mouth's so fire
I should be burnt to the ground
There's a fuckin' circus in town, yeah, bitch, this verse finna clown, ICP
R. Kelly sex tape, I see pee (Look)
My shit is intense (In tents) like tipis
You gettin' wiped like TP
You don't like me? You can bite my little white wee-wee
And I repeat, you can bite my little white wee-wee long as I L-I-V-E
And ever since my pre-teens, striped Lee jeans and Grandma Nan's little black and white TV (Yeah)
Now I'm so bougie that I stick out my pinkie every time I drink tea
Used to wanna wife Sweet Tee (Sweet Tee)
Used to rock wife beaters, now I let your wife beat me (Yeah)
So you can eat shit, but I might be the shit
So when I say ""Eat shit,"" I mean me"

Must Be the Ganja

[Intro]
Yeah, ohh, yeah yeah, ohh
I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me (High)
I said, I smell something in the air that's making me high

[Verse 1]
Okay, here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, fa-so-la-ti-da-so
Lyrical Roscoe, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick-axe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe 'cross your six-pack with X-acto
Knives, stranglin' wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home, my lil' vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, nor what you thought, so
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

[Verse 2]
Your dreams are gettin' fulfilled, ooh, I'm literally gettin' a chill
Spittin' at will, me and Dre have just finished splittin' a pill
You're submittin' to skill, sittin' still
I'm admittin' I'm beginnin' to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma: I can be Dalai Lama
And be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me, mama, you're lookin' sexy, mama
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know who can name every serial
Killer who ever existed in a row?
Put 'em in chronological order, beginnin' with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place; from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods, where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which lake they found her in, how they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife, and which nun
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun

[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

[Verse 3]
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light
Behind the board sits Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a LinnDrum, make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Startin' from scratch and then endin' up at the ending of
Capable of winnin' a Pulitzer
So unbelievable, it's a titanium cranium that's full of sur–
–prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos (High)
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking

[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind"

Higher

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
You know, I've been around for a while now
Not sure if I have much left to prove
Yeah I do, haha

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I look at me now, I'm thinkin', ""Damn""
How proud of me I am
What I did is nothin' to sneeze at
Even if your allergies are bad
I'm up in a balcony in France
I look around, I see the fans
How they surround me in the stands
Probably could drown in a sea of hands
They're hollerin', ""Shady"" (""Shady"")
Yelling it out to me and that's what I mean when I say
That one day someway, somehow, if I get the chance to get a crowd
I'd flip it around and have a crowd give me the chants
(I've done it all, man)
But in actuality, I haven't, yet

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Eminem, Sly Pyper]
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (My only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All I know is, all)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Got no time for no haters in this bitch
Or toleration for this shit
But like medication, my dedication
And the time it takes to do this shit
Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waiting room'll get
What I mean is maybe I have more patience (patients) than I'm able to admit
Yeah, but I'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch
Fame was a switch, but I was grateful to trade this shit for the trailer with a hitch
That it would make me a raving lunatic
But I made it through my situation, I hit pay dirt
Now I get paper like a stapler in this bitch
But just 'cause I made a little bit of change
Don't mean I've changed a little bit
Brain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this English language when it's lit
And I'm just berating you with it, it's Shady 'til I'm eighty-two
I'll spit this crazy, even Dre, he knows (nose) I'ma blow
Better get the handkerchief again, haha

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (Know I talk about this shit a lot, my only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All I know is, all)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

[Bridge: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
Oh, now what am I gonna do?
Can't nothing hold me, I'm on the loose
Born a winner, damn, it's so hard to lose
I can do it even when I'm tryin' to
When my record flops, it still go through the roof
This atmosphere's for a chosen few
Who was on they grind makin' money moves
And you ain't gon' get there if you watered-down
You gotta take shots with a hundred proof (Check it out)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Been in survival mode
Since a five year old, it was I alone
Since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone
But lookin' back how bad it was then
If it hadn't been for the pad and the pen
Addict mom and deadbeat dad
I wouldn't have had the savage within
Havin' to win every single battle I'm in
All I ever wanted was to be an emcee
Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me
EPMD must've had teachin' degrees
Learned to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes
Would be as Eazy as E
And graffiti would be like remedial readin' to me (Yeah)
'Til my last breath leaves my lungs
I'ma beat my drum (Yeah) for the streets I'm from (Yeah)
The East side slums (Yeah), gotta remind 'em (Yeah)
I'll take a foe out (Yeah), like fee-fi-fum
You see my finger (What?), you see my thumb (What?)
You see my fist, fuck a peace pipe, I'm (What?)
Here for the smoke but it's not the weed I want (What?)
With this beat I brung for the beef I've come (Woo)
But you better bring it if you wanna reply from
'Cause for you to be lyrically inclined, it'd be a steep climb up
That'll be an uphill battle
But I'm up like your feet in a recliner
And I think I'm about to go out on a limb like a tree climber
Time to push my ceiling higher 'cause

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (For the last time, my only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All I know is, all)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (Damn)"

Careful What You Wish For

[Intro]
""Breaking news: Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour to check himself into rehab after admitting an addiction to sleep medication
We'll have more on this story as it develops.""
""Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently survived a gunshot to the head in what appears to be a random drive-by shooting
Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be alienated--""
""On again/off again relationship with...""
""This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus...""
""Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire at an after-hours club, we've learned that the rapper Proof has been fatally shot""
""Shady/Aftermath recording artist...""
""Long-time best friend of Eminem and a member of the rap group D12""
""D12, back in the news again today...""
""Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation continue to swirl around Eminem
He insists he's just taking a break, but doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask, 'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'""

[Verse 1]
So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit, then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert
I was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a three, then three
Years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold

[Verse 2]
I got a letter from a fan that said he's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every letter I get
But something told me to go ahead and open it
But why would someone pray for you
When they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watching it from a opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now, on how to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold"

Ayo, dawg, I got some shit on my motherfuckin' chest
That I need to get off 'cause if I don't
I'ma fuckin' explode or somethin'
Now, look, this is the story about
Some little fuckin' girls that I know
It goes like this

[Verse 1]
It's so easy for me to make enemies any more, it's sickening
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin' their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that I don't wanna be in shit
I never had no beef with you corny son-of-a-bitches
But now the shit is broken, you can't do nothin' to fix it
So I'm tellin' you right now, motherfuck a Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real, B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin, see, he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpackin' cipherin' name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you were sayin' and
I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentioning me
That little fuckin' weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
Talkin' 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?
Come on, dawg, he was s'posed to be on that song
Talkin' 'bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?
What's wrong? You scared? And Fred, you said you was dissin' him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin' sissy, up on stage, screamin' how people hate you
They don't hate you, they just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin' my ass
'Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song, I'm tryna to pre-warn you
Lethal, when I fuckin' see you, dog, I'm swingin' on you!
Motherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all some...

[Hook]
Girls (Y'all are some goddamn girls)
Why do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies, you pussies
Keep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know, hah)
How fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'!)
In fuckin' Bentleys and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

[Post-Hook]
Now, I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

[Verse 2]
Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
See, I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'd die for me like I'd die for them
I'd fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all of my dawgs, from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away
In my coffin I'll never soften, no matter how often I'm tested
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again no, nope
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin' off me
I'm not bein' cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin' me
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger (hey!)
I say, ""Fuck Christina!"",  he says, ""Fuck Christina!"", but meaner
So from doin' a song with Method to beggin' to get accepted
I'm peggin' Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin' you up, punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin'!
And fuck Bizkit! 'Cause I know you're sayin', ""Fuck D12!""
Only not to our face, under your breath to yourselves
Little ...

[Hook]
Girls (Motherfuckin' females)
Why do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies, you pussies
Keep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know the truth)
How fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'!)
In fuckin' Bentley's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

[Post-Hook]
Now, I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

[Outro]
And that's it, that's all there is to it, dawg
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin' song
Don't say you're down with doin' the fuckin' song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin' MTV talkin' about
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin' ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford, dawg
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
That's all you had to fuckin' say, I wouldn'ta said shit
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin' song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
Now, I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckin-you-up-shit when I see you
And I will see you, too
Oh, and by the way, Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
Haha!"

Say What You Say

[Intro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Heh, so I'm out the game, huh? (Huh, huh)
Yo, Dre, we ridin'?
Whatever (Ha-ha)
Well, I'm wit' ya, homie
Okay, let's handle the small shit

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
Corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep goin'
First take I make, mistakes, just keep it
No punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age — But what about Jermaine?
Fuck Jermaine! He don't belong speakin' mine
Or Timbaland's name and don't think I don't read
Your little interviews and see what you're sayin'
And I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me with a bunch of little mini-you's
Runnin' around your backyard swimming pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with 10- or 11-year-olds

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you blackballed
And make sure you never rap a-fuckin'-gain
Dre ain't havin' it, long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
‘Cause I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck: white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mil'
Or grow up to be Attila, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm something of a phenom, one puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and
On top again, there's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (C'mon!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now anybody who knows Dre knows I'm about
Fast cars and Alizé, partyin' all day
But I handled my business, ‘cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin' it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
‘Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it, and you'll die tryna violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated
Huh, like my old lady?
‘Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
Is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact
And I'm gone, and I'm back, I speed write
And my loose leaf's my launchpad — And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything, catch a contract
On your head, you headed West, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest and invest in something to protect
Your head and neck — And it's back and forth
All day, like Red and Meth, I joke when I say I'm the best
In the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death; five mics in The Source?
Ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath, but I'll suffocate for the respect
'Fore I breathe to collect a fuckin' check

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Outro: Dr. Dre & Timbaland]
Watch your fuckin' mouth
Yo, this Timbaland, tell him I said suck my dick"

Right for Me

[Verse 1]
I feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals, glue sniffin', pools of vomit at Bonnaroo
But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston
In the corner tryin' to seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off I'm on mushrooms, so fuck all of you!
Roses are violet, mollies are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion, it's all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
‘Cause I think I started hallucinating, ‘cause I just thought I heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future's new shit
And all I could do was follow the music
And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Fillin' water balloons with nail-polish remover
Just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes
I feel uptight, I gotta get looser
After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice, so I'm not as deluded
‘Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
Excusez-moi, but that hoochie that passed
You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
Butt juicier, ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth-waterin' too
So I walked over to her, like, “I’m Marshall
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll introduce ya""
Oh, I'm a misogynist too, but I'm not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth, uh!
Chronic abuser, and I don't mean a user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a Ruger, a Glock, and a nuke
And a Rottweiler too, and I'm not in the mood, so
When I say I'm bringing the TEC out
I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
God, I'm gonna puke, I'm so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofah
I'm tore up, demolished, I'm fuckin' stoned like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are loony tunes
The box of reusable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
That were placed next to Veronica's boobs
And the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box
In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues
The girl was just not the one suitable for him

[Hook]
Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don’t laugh, please listen to me

[Verse 2]
Thought I’d give in to the pressure
Collapse and crumble perhaps, relapsing under that
Well, that's a bunch of crap
In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap
And I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Like it's a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
‘Cause push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
Disgruntled, had some struggles, yeah
But that passion and hunger's back
What a fantastic juggling act!
And the way I flip my tongue on the track
It's like verbal acrobatics, but in fact
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
After I strapped a duffel bag to my back
And stuffed a massive punchin' bag in it
And an elastic bungee strap, rubber, plaster, a thumb tack
And a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic and fuckin' snapped
Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
And for my last trick, lunge on back
Latch on a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snap the rudder in half
Chuckled and laughed, utter my last rebuttal
And just as I'm to come crashin'
I grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat
Rub my magic mushroom tat
For luck, then splat, get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up, then gasp, lungs collapsed
And that's more likely than finding someone that's…

[Hook]
Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don’t laugh, please listen to me

[Verse 3]
Couple of shots of Jäger
Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
Flooded with thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'
""You're top ten, ain't cha?""
Stop it, you fuckers are talkin' crazy
And stop interrupting, you're not even up in that conversation
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Underground, pop, or nameless
Whatever your job is, I give a fuck what's your occupation
You're thinkin' just ‘cause you came in with scrubs
And you brought the scalpel and sponge
The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once you done swapped your name with him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan
If you dug him up; Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles, bacon
A fuckin' McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagled it
Flung it across the table
Then bump it and knock it shake it
Jumped and got in the way, then disrupted my concentration
I said fuck it and lost my patience
They all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of you Dr. Dre, so then what is it got you thinkin'
You can fuck with this operation?!
(Aftermath) Still running hip-hop amazin'
I'm still pluggin' along
No need for an assumption, here's confirmation
I'm up for the long duration
I'm just looking for something to walk away with
Some pocket change and a little integrity
Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
'Til I'm fuckin' Madonna's age and
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
But I shit you not like I'm plugged up with constipation
That day will come
Before I finally stumble upon some lady that’s…

[Hook]
Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don’t laugh, please listen to me"

Kick Off (Freestyle)

[Intro: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
""I've always looked at battle rap as competition or war, and the main objective is to destroy, completely fuckin’ obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything, whatever the fuck you can, to get a reaction from the crowd. So nothing's off limits.""
I need you to spit that lyrical miracle… in the swimming pool

[Verse 1]
Before this kicks off, let me set my balls on this tees
'Cause I’m dottin' i's every time I cross one of these
There's not a redeeming quality at all in me
It's impossible, seems like an implausible dream
Positive clean thoughts intervene
But they're all either altered and mean
Assault and demean, tossed and they're being lost in the scheme
Squashed in between a brainwashing machine
Like an Islamic regime, a jihadist extreme radical
Suicide bomber that's seeing
Ariana Grande sing her last song of the evening
And as the audience from the damn concert is leaving
Detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region
I’m not gonna finish that, for obvious reasons
But bring your dogs, I’ma muzzle 'em
I’m not Middle Eastern but I'll make a bitch rock a hijab
And at least a extra large in a T-shirt
Headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet, hasta la vista
I go Hamas on the beats, a paradox on the beach
And a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list
Gettin' head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich
Professional shit sprayer
Bitch watch who you talkin' to, like Apple wristwear
Endangered species in this ABC shit a bit scarce
Prey’s decreasing, I face extinction like disc players
Told this chick she's hot as Jada Pinkett
And just stared 'til I made her think it
Said, ""Maybe we should just get married.""
She's facing me, I placed my feet with my hips square
Tell her, ""Turn around,"" spread her legs for me, then I hit bare
Leave her stretched out like a baby T-shirt on Ric Flair
As I rip, tear, anal beads in a split rear
Spray Febreze in the chick's hair
Make her wheeze tryna get air
I played for keeps, there's no escaping me, I have a bitch scared
And chained to me, and throw away the key
And she'll be so afraid to leave
That even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there
Tryin' to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up
It's impossible like rapin' a slut
We stay butt-naked and fuck
You're close, wait for you, what?
My idea, you comin' too, is waking you up
With smelling salts after I Quaalude your cup
That'll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup
Hate to get bogged down in details
But bitch, I'm like the dog pound with females
My brain is corrupt, real life, Hillside Strangler
I strangle a skank's neck 'til it's triangular
Shaped but it's upside down, and my mouth ain't gonna shut
And mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck
Or helps you rake in the ducats, I want payment in pub
'Cause I ain't tryna get in your bars like I'm waiting the club
But if you put me in your lines, I'm takin' a cut

[Verse 2]
Get a million writers inside of a room combined in it
Try to get every idea of every possible line to spit
Every punchline, every combination that rhymes with it
Bitch, a whole team can't see me, there's no I's in it
Head so big, I shot myself ten times in it
Tryna commit suicide and it took five minutes
And I survived this shit
Someone's gonna challenge me, who?
Battle me and win, that's a fucking fallacy too
You name one motherfucker in this galaxy, *spits*, reality
You fantasy, rally your troops, try to boost the morale
Only time I start a movement's a bowel
I can't even give a ""yeah"" or a ""woo"" when you rap in the booth
Not even a ""nah"" or a ""boo""
'Cause even though I'm allergic to the crap that you spew
When I'm 'bout to break out, I don't mean get a rash from it too
'Cause when I say I have allergies, I actually do
But that's just an analogy, I've never had a reaction to you

[Verse 3]
Creature from the Black Lagoon
I reach up and I smack the moon
You're grief struck that I'm back so soon
Your teacher for this afternoon
Creep up with a pack of hoodlums
We pack a punch like Caprisun
Heat tucked like we each snuck in a sub-machine gun
We stuck in a submarine bun, with a bag of shrooms
Cup of lean up in the padded room
Justin Bieber in a Catholic school
Selling dust and reefer when your back is to him
Don't adjust your speaker
I'll cuss the stripes off of a fuckin' zebra when I'm at the zoo
Huffin' cleaner 'til I gag from fumes
Fuck Christina with a plastic spoon
While I bump some G-Funk and blast some Snoop
'Cause her double G-cups are massive, huge!
It's fun for me just to grab a boob
Plus my penis got an attitude
My fuckin' wiener's in a combative mood
Come and suck a mean one like it's mad at you
I speak tongue-in-cheek, what you asslicks do
'Cause you love to eat butt, it's sad but true

[Verse 4]
I just sprung a leak suddenly
What I think in my gut instinct become in sync
My thoughts and my stomach link up with each other
Ink touches the pad, then boom!
Since the day Dre gave me beats, I was made elite
That's basically what makes me me
Creating stink, 'til these tats are fading ink
Who's the greatest? Think we're still debating, wink
ADD, and better put out an APB
'Cause it'll take LAPD and me layin' in the street
For you to see Shady beat
And I'll bet ya they'd need cleats
'Cause I'd have to be stomped by forty men to suffer a defeat
I pray please Jesus to make me decent
Inhaling the main ingredient of pain relievers, and saline
I take three Aleves, tryna break these fevers, I'm ailing
I stay free of divas and ladies screamin'
'Cause they keep schemin' on me
Vading keepin' the women at bay
Like Laci Peterson, baby fetuses
Legs and feet have been weighted, chained in semen
It's straight demon—and wait!
Even if it takes meat cleavers to make believers
Mistake-free schemes are enablin' me to remain deviant
Breakbeat, eat her like steak meat
Emcees take seats like AMC theaters
Deranged ringleader, depraved king
Who mainstream media hates
Which makes things easier, still under scrutiny
Villainous smooth criminal, livin' room
With the nude Reese Witherspoon
Who was bruised, beat with a broom
It's in two pieces, and lays deceased in it
Pit with a chewed leash, and his chain-link leapin' it
Live in the booth, shave, eat, bathe, drink, sleep in it
R-A-P bleed the shit, still and I poop, pee it
It's a spillage, a sewage leak, waist-deep feces
The syllables ooze fecal, they feel like renewed leases
'Cause my brain releases 'em

[Verse 5]
Like waste excretion, it's simultaneously
As I'm givin' these fools grief, they're feelin' the blues
'Cause even if stealin' my shoes, thieves
Just to fill 'em's a huge feat
A hill and it's too steep
Obey these demons, we're still in cahoots
Keep feedin' me blank sheets
As soon as I sank these teeth
And I'm killin' the loose leaf
Time to shake these trees again
Wait, make that phrase repeat again
Killin' the loose leaf, shake these trees again
Get the rake, but it ain't me leavin' 'em

[Verse 6]
Vicodins, Nuprins, I bite them and chew them
The whites and the blues mixed with nitrous balloons
And I like to sniff gluesticks, put Ricin on toothpicks
On the mic I'm just ruthless, a crisis, a nuisance
Who I influence I give two shits
If they wanna license my music to entice with
Then use the shit like it's the blueprint for ISIS recruitment

[Verse 7]
Excuse me while I stare into space for a few
In a daze or a haze, glazed over, crazed warped loon
Mental cased off, always had a straight-forward view
But you bozos keep givin' the flamethrower fuel
No one's ever sank lower, shrewd, and way more rude
Beast-mode like a lawn-mower blade rolled through it
And this has little to do with bein' gay, boy
It's just where the wordplay's goin'
But ain't much I can say or do
'Cause ain't no excuse, the way I go at you {censored}
You say I'm always screw-faced
So if I look your way, you're screwed
'Cause if looks could kill, I could start a hate war too
'Cause I'd murder you straight bitches by turnin' the gaze on you

[Verse 8]
Let's take it back before the tightly-worn pants
To the Nike, Jordan hats
The stripe Lee's, Jordache, and the white tees
Lightning storms might be formed fast
Such a frightening forecast
But when you're slightly hoarse, rasp
From the cyphering or gasp, but still reciting your raps
While you're tightening your grasp around the mic 'cause you done shitted on it so much, you're always reminded of your past
'Cause your heiny's sore, that's
'Cause you still haven't finished fuckin' wiping your ass
From the night before last
No good, but rap's somethin' I'm too-good-for-my-own-good at
Fuck adulthood, I'm a grown-up brat
Where your cojones at? Mine are always being rode, in fact
They're frozen, you ever seen a cul-de-sac?
So big they fell out my scrotum, I just sewed 'em back

[Verse 9]
Dick so long, need a shoulder-strap
For that, gotta unroll it and fold it back
So difficult to wrap in the prophylactic, it overlaps it
So I pack a Trojan so fat, when I lay it flat it's like a yoga mat
Make a bitch think she's in aerobics class
The bear you don't wanna poke is back
The backbone of rap, your fuckin' lead singles are my bonus tracks
When I appear, my peers stop
Hearts fall in their stomach, their spirits drop
Careers flop, their gears lock, severe shock
Fear at the mere thought
Lyrics are top-tier, I'm so high at the top
I'm in the sky when I talk
Bitch, I'm so fly when I walk, my ears pop

[Outro]
Oh, and I'm just playin' ladies, you know I love you
I got a idea for a line"

Love You More

Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you

You don't want me, I just want you more

I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 2]
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah!
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
""Someone else,"" problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up

[Bridge]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me, whore

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more"

Guns Blazing

[Intro: Sly Pyper & Dr. Dre]
It's time to face the music
A stay of execution
No more distribution
(The fuck you doin'?)

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Dr. Dre]
You did this to me
I'm right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets
Just remember that you did this to yourself (Yeah, you did it to yourself)
Now you gotta suffer the consequences
Back up to bat and swingin' for the fences (Remember that)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Sly Pyper]
Let's make one thing clear, here, here, my dear
My resolute for this year
No pollution, fresh air

Mile high club 'til I jеt lag
Rothstein flow, Casino
And you're just like Gingеr, we know
Single negro, I don't need your (Double standards and hypocrisy)
And that fake handholdin' on Father's Day
You a different motherfucker when you're not with me
Been sleepin' with the enemy, mockery
It's like I'm John F. Kennedy, shots at me
Yes, I'm president of debauchery
None of that bullshit ever got to me
'Cause your pillow Brillo, ditto
Breakin' this shit down little by little
I ain't got time for the fuckin' pom-poms
Shoulda never let this dog out of that kennel

[Refrain: Sly Pyper, Dr. Dre & Both]
Wastin' time, debatin' 'bout
Who I'm with when I'm not around
Just don't forget who you fuckin' wit'
When steppin' on hallowed ground

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
('Cause) You did this to me (Yeah, I'm)
Right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets
Just remember that you did this to yourself (Yeah, you did it to yourself)
But now you gotta suffer the consequences
(And ""sorry"" isn't gonna help, nah)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Sly Pyper]
How many times have I got burnt and tried to act like I'm not hurt? (What?)
Or take you back and we not work, like clockwork
This shit is agony, you're draggin' me, Glocks burst
Just remember, you drawed first
You ain't toe taggin' me, ho-bag, any blowback, you deserve
Get the bozack, bitch (Yeah), my soul's blackening
So actually, this could've been a lot worse (Why?)
I could've name-dropped you in my verse (Yeah)
But out of respect for your daughter
I won't blow your spot up 'cause your toddler
Does not deserve to get caught up in our dirt (Damn)
And good luck with her father
Bitch, you're stuck with him now, ha-fuckin'-ha
Word to the doctor, these are wounds you cannot nurse
Hope it's drivin' you bonkers, that I'm not yours (Oh no, woo)
Guess I must've got wise, you are not sly
Just 'cause you can make up an on-the-spot lie
I'm comin' out, guns blazin', shots fired
'Hand sani', I'm cutting off 'tize' (Ties)
Bitch, everything you own's in a box, bye
Guess it's back to the trailer and pot pies
Hope I pull up to the window at Popeyes
One day and you'll be servin' me hot fries 'cause (You did this to me)
Taste of your own medicine
You shedded skin, yeah, you reptilian bitch
Off of your knees (Yeah), beggin' for forgiveness
Yeah, look at you, marry him again, bitch
You ain't Em's bitch, you're just regular him's bitch
We will never be together again, ever
And when you're in bed with him and you wish you was with me
Just remember that

[Chorus: Sly Pyper, Eminem & Both]
You did this to me (Yeah, now)
I'm right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets (Look what you did)
Just remember that you did this to yourself (Yeah, you did it to yourself)
But now you gotta suffer the consequences
(And ""sorry"" isn't gonna help)
Remember that (Michelle) you did this to me (Yeah)
I'm right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets (Fuck around and make you famous)
Just remember that you did this to yourself (Yeah, you did it to yourself)
But now you gotta suffer the consequences (Oh no)
(So when I'm hittin' someone else and you're)

[Refrain: Sly Pyper, Dr. Dre & Both]
Wastin' time, debatin' 'bout
Who I'm with when I'm not around
Just don't forget who you fuckin' wit'
When steppin' on hallowed ground"

Puke

[Intro]
*Eminem pukes into the toilet*
*Eminem hocks and spits into the toilet*
*Toilet flush*
There I go, thinking of you again

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 1]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'ma start right here, I'll just be brief, I'm
'Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim (Shi-i-i-i-i-i-it)
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you (Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo)

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 2]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle
You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die (Di-i-i-i-i-i-ie)
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack (A-a-a-a-a-a-ack)
But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do is pu-u-u-u-u-u-uke

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

Music Box

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, girl
Can you hear that? It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

[Verse 1]
You hear the beat as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door; it's locked, so I go to creep
'Round the back with binoculars, not 'cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums; oh, look
Here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placing hot, smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em; he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBenét Rams'
I guess a modern-day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 2]
I almost look comatose; who wants to be sober? Gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know
I put on my mother's makeup, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?
The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up, and the tune just starts
It's playing a song, so beautiful, and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 3]
I'm fixated on asphyxiatin' and breakin'
This little chick's neck like a Pixy Stick
The sick, Satan-worshippin' bitches get horse whippings
I'm in the back, through the back door slippin'
Through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above
Forced entry, the more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doing this for more than a quarter-century, I'm just numb
Am I dreaming, is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
With a bat; a matter of fact, that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back, like ""Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula""
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that: cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?"

G.O.A.T.

[Intro]
And I’m willing to borrow your grass
But I specialize in eating MC's
In the immortal words of LL Cool J
As he would say: ""I'm a G.O.A.T.!""
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Verse 1]
This is the part I was worried about
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
And I'm in some dusty garage
Inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes
And everyone's tellin' me what I should do
And how I should come out and what to rap about
And I know I got a lot up
In my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
They're probably gonna think that I'm comin' off as cocky
Like I just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me
See, the thing about me
Is you don't really know a thing about me
Everyone's makin' a stink about me
Like there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters
Killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals
And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them
Than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
But see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
But why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other MC's?
So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay Z
Please be that just subliminally
Means he thinks Jigga's the best
And that he's the only one up in that league, see
And it's easy just to consider me
One of the greatest white rappers there is
Knowin' goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived, period

[Hook]
I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Verse 2]
Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
So they gotta go try to find 'em a new Eminem or a new Shady
If they think it's gonna happen, man, I thought I was crazy
Or maybe I could be takin' it wrong
And they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up that Paul Wall's white
‘Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
And Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
Because he's so caught up in that snow white
That Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
He's so gone off that coke, right?
And it's so sad ‘cause he's dope, right?
America's next great white hope, right?
So now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny-ass White Rapper Show, right?
And which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
They said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out
There's somethin' about a white boy talkin' black
And runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
And I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
""Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white
And the best golfer's black?""
And I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that
But these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out
But I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin' me now
When suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
All of the hatred for me must've died
Thought I committed career suicide
So I had to turn back into the bad guy
So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
And Angelina Jolie is just another ho
And Brad is a sucka, because once I fuck her
She wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
You know what I say? — ""No.""
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
She needs all the publicity she can get
You wanted Shady, well you got it, man, I ain't apologizin' for shit

[Hook]
I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look
If they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Outro]
Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home
Man, shit is too easy
Nobody even wants to pass me the ball
‘Cause I'm a G.O.A.T.
So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game
And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
But y'all know that I'm a G.O.A.T.
And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
Before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
But before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much
To everybody who wasn't there from the start
And thank you very much to everybody who was
And y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it
‘Cause I know that you know that I know
That you know that I know that I'm a G.O.A.T.
I'm out y'all, it's been real—peace!"

One Shot 2 Shot

*gunshots and crowd hollering*

[Intro: Fatt Father]
I told y'all motherfuckers I was coming back (Oh shit)
What now, nigga? What now? What? Brewster Projects, nigga

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga what about yo' wife?) Nigga, fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit! The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the Saint Andrew's door
(Hey man) ...That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forgot my TEC
I don't see nobody, but Fatt Father and Hex

[Verse 2: Kuniva & (Eminem)]
(Kuniva, you alright?) These niggas is tripping (Where's Bizarre at?) (I don't know, man)
I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wylin'
Two minutes ago, we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier, and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
She got hit, and now she's yelling (Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38, I hope it's not too late!

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 3: Swift & (Kon Artis)]
(I been trying to call you all day, motherfucker, where you at?)
I'm on 7 Mile...what the fuck was that?
Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with? They car?) With a gat, nigga, and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with!)
Man! (I swear!) And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, 3,000 and some odd
Fans and some cum-wad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away’s the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a Mazel Tov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah, I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again, I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps, looked up, and I seen Swift shooting it out
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left hand, Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although, I can't stay here to fight, 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right, bitches, I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (Bitch, bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off"

Encore / Curtains Down

[Intro: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Sh-sh-sh, Shady! Aftermath! Haha!
G-G-G-G, G-Unit! Haha!

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
’Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the doctor, come on now
Here we go, cliff hanger, it’s another club banger
Got ya' hangin’ on the edge of your seat, get on down

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Time’s up, game’s over, you lose, I win
’Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who’s got you goin’ crazy again
I’m a trend, I set one every time I’m in
I go out, and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you something that we already had
But once you’re gone, you don’t come back (Oh!)
Too bad, you’re off the map now, radar can’t even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around, just playin’ the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin’ and moanin’, whining and bitchin’
Sit and observe, listen, you’ll learn if you pay attention
Why 10 multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, we’re on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin’

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
’Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem, Dr. Dre & 50 Cent]
When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk
Get it crunk! Crunk! Crunk! Crunk!
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot, and jump
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don’t gotta' promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin’ off the hinges
We ain’t showin’ off, we just going off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin’?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, ’cause Doc left you all guessin’
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?!)
We gon’ have this motherfucker hoppin’ in a second (Bump, bump!)
That’s why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
’Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn’t for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
To pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game
That’s why we came to…

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
’Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem]
50 Cent, come on!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent, Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It’s no secret, everybody know
When Dre’s involved, there’s plenty of money involved
And plenty honey’s involved and sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, everyday is just another party
From the valleys all the way to them 8 Mile alleys
Let’s rally, hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre’s about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin’ out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speakers
So never say never ’cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the
The Doc and Shady, no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that a…

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
We came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Outro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Yeah, haha! Still Aftermath, 2006! And don’t worry about that Detox album, it’s comin’… We gon’ make Dre do it! Haha! 50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre! We ain’t leaving, let’s go, haha! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out! Peace!
*People chanting Eminem’s name*
*Eminem Leaves*
*Slim Shady's Footsteps*
Oh shit! I almost forgot…
*Girl screams as Shady pulls out a gun*
You’re coming with me!
*Eminem cocks the gun and starts shooting at the audience*
*People start to scream terrified and run*
*Gunshots and shouting*
Ha ha ha. Bye, bye!
*Eminem shoots himself*
See you in hell, fuckers!"

Evil Deeds

[Intro]
Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 1]
Momma had a baby and its head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
But Momma don't want me, the next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
Ring-ring-ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors, on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither, so they left me on someone else's lawn
Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn
'Til somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle, Edna and Charles
Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, they were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary, they'd gang up on me and sing this song
Sing this song, sing this song, sing this song, sing this song
It went a little something like
""Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn""
Momma why do they keep sayin' this? I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 2]
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly-white, predominantly black. Well, what about me?
Where does that leave me? Well, I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again, I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomitin'; what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kiddin'? What do I look like, some kinda idi...
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that; why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit? It's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish
""Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin' about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it
Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it. That little rich, poor, white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it
Man, if I only had half of it""
Shit, if you only knew the half of it...
Haha

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 3]
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, Mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn
Never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why are you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale. I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring-around-the-rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off-and-on? This ain't what I chose to be
So please, God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
I said, Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
(Evil deeds, evil deeds, evil deeds)

[Outro]
[Gunshot]
[Crowd cheering]
Oh!
Last one, baby, let's go
Last one, baby, let's go

My Fault

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 1]
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date (Ooh)
Susan, an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music (What up?)
Told me she was going back into usin' again (Nah)
I said, ""Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze and the gin
C'mere, let's go in here, who's in the den?""
""It's me and Kelly!""
""My bad"" (Sorry)
""Let's try another room""
""I don't trust you""
""Shut up, slut, chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods""
""Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab""
""Oh dag"" (Mmm)
""I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag""
""Huh?""

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (I'm sorry)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 2]
""Yo, Sue""
""Get away from me, I don't know you""
""Oh shoot, she's trippin'""
""I need to go puke"" (Blehh)
""I wasn't tryna turn this into somethin' major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out (Nah)""
She said, ""Help me, I think I'm havin' a seizure""
I said, ""I'm high too, bitch, quit grabbin' my T-shirt (Let go)
Would you calm down? You're startin' to scare me""
She said, ""I'm 26 years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook""
""(Hello) I'm over here, Sue (Hi)
You're talking to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
'Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate""

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl (Whoops)
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (It's an accident)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 3]
""Susan, wait, where you goin'? You better be careful""
""Leave me alone, dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled""
""I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
'Fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these
(I'ma kill him)
John, where's Dave at? Before I bash you""
""He's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap, dude""
""Dave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, choppin' her hair off
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
How long do these things take to wear off?""
""Well, it depends on how many you had""
""I took three, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol""
""She's gonna die, dude""
""I know and it's my fault""
""Oh my God""

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry)
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Outro]
My God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Susan, please wake up, please
Please wake up, what are you doing?!
You're not dead, you're not dead
I know you're not dead
Wake up, Susan, wake up
Oh my God"

Elevator

[Intro]
All aboard!
Okay, next stop, my basement (Ha-ha)
I'll meet you down there!

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, ""What if you went platinum?"", I'd just laugh at him
""That's not happening, that I can't fathom""
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 1]
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touché me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Whoopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy
That's a no-no, even she knows Da-Da's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cuckoo, bananas, fucking-A, B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's 'cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep up on ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen, man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted 'cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters, turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I oughta just be honest, but

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, ""What if you went platinum?"", I'd just laugh at him
""That's not happening, that I can't fathom""
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 2]
""Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad when I call them both faggots""
All these fucking voices in my head, I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason, slash, Leatherface, and
Together makes 'em a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the Wiener Schnitzel up his ass, hopped away, some-
-body please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
Homie, I'm the Scheiße, ask Doctor Dreson
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away, son
No, not a-now, not a chance, not today, son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stain, feck it
I'll just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre

Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 3]
Elevator in my house, hah, smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in the microwave, I'm
Thinking 'bout an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbors step away, then I just pepper-sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hide out, drive by my house and beep
Like, now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down, fucker (Bah), try counting sheep
And you're tryna find out why now there's beef
Mace in your face, bitch, cry now, pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above 'em just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling ""Stop!""

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre

[Outro]
You fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A, even got a bidet
To wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it, the shit's awesome
Yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator"

Eminem Freestyles on Tim Westwood | 2010

[Verse 1: Mr. Porter]
Welcome to the ill world of Mr. P-O
Ayy, keep the talk, B, I'm tryna see dough
If it ain't about bread, what we gon' speak fo'?
If it ain't no lead, then it ain't no beef, bro
You better get a leash ‘cause yo' freak ho
Specialize in wood like she Home Depot
I'm like Chico DeBarge, we stars
Roscoe P. Coltrane in these bars
Man, Amtrak, I'll break her damn back
Man, it's Ralph Lauren, this ain't no damn Chaps
It's all Polo, I'm so pro though
You bird-crazy; El Pollo Loco
Talkin' about cheese and this ain't no photo
Askin' about rings like the ho know Frodo
You better get out of my house and shit
I think I threw up in my mouth a bit: I'm sick

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9""]
Niggas be lyin', talkin' about they bust a heater
Once I see him, maybe more like Justin Bieber
Leavin' my rivals underground, like Skyzoo's, how I do
I have him layin' in the street and bleedin', butt-naked
With a bullet in his mothafuckin' head like Erykah Badu
I find irony in bein' in a place
Where I'm wearin' Gucci, mane, gettin' whiteboy wasted
I tell a nigga: break bread or take lead
I'm tryin' to get rid of this weight, like K-Fed
Me and Denaun got a gangsta bond
We like that once-in-a-lifetime thing to you
That ain't the prom
The next MC that rhyme official, with ref, with a whistle
That ain't Young Money, I'ma definitely diss you
If you rhymin' ""packin' a MAC"" with ""back of the Acura""
Or perhaps you can't match my spectacular vernacular
You still rhymin' bottles with models, college with knowledge
Usin' the word swagger, you're probably garbage
You thugs funny, comparin' 5'9"" to anybody
You comparin' Superman to Bugs Bunny

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm like a white Michael – Vick, psycho enough to stick
Michael J. Fox in a microwave with a Rott
I might make a little Alizé with a side of NyQuil
And ride a motorcycle bike
Right through the side of my high school
Satan's disciple with a sniper rifle
And a knife and a white diaper
Liable to shit on you while I snipe you
So dope he gets off opiates
What an appropriate way to start off his day!
He may just smart off to Dre
He may be hard to contain
‘Cause his rage is so hard to gauge
See, Hannibal ate his face, and met Jason, gnawed off his leg
Amazin' hard-on for razors and blades
And anything sharp, even poisonous darts
It all plays a major part of his game
Holy water won't ward him off, crucifixes won't do the trick
He's so sick, it's ridiculous
Sawed the crazy part off his brain, he's still insane
Why's there bloodstains on his carpet, mane?
There's some crazy shit goin' on in Shady's apartment again

[Verse 4: Mr. Porter]
Okay, it's back to the blocks, slingin' yay like the old days
Superman on the beat, I carry my whole state
You wooden legs to a house: you can't hold weight
Oh shit, it's O'Shea Jackson… okay
A little bit of this twisted out with Obama in it
Mr. Porter back with anthrax, like Osama sent him
Bitch, I'm all that, I drive the girls crazy
They gotta look at Rorschachs to get they thoughts back
I ain't a small fry, small ticker, small tack
I make 'em all cry with big dick and raw sack
The potblood of science to return a raw rap
I'm the best, mane; Eli Porter stance

[Verse 5: Royce da 5'9""]
Y'all bitches should call Nickle the Don Bishop
A poet, a mixture of Don Goines and John Grisham
Flow'll have you rewindin' it four or five times
That landmine rhyme written with porcupine line
Step up in here with the Slaughterhouse
C.O.B. Gang will approach you
And bend your gun barrel to a horseshoe
Only fuck with monsters, we the truth
Monsters will pop up on you
Like you said ""Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.""
I can't even see the booth, I could fit in Stevie's shoe
I'm sick, I got the Desert Eagle flu
I'm rich, lil' nigga, we don't need a cent, we Teflon
The doctor tried to take blood, the needle bent; ask Mom
Outta my mind if you can imagine
Usin' Magic's johnson without a condom, I'm bonkers
Got the streets goin', dude, it's tremendous
If I come for your blood, I ain't gon' be usin' syringes

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Newsflash, I'm still trash
Them pills shoulda killed my ass
But they didn't; they just made me stronger
It's like they rebuilt my ass
Like the Six Million Dollar Man after the crash
It's Aftermath, bitch! And my milk glass is still half-empty
Yeah, tempt me, Hell isn't enough
They need to invent somewhere new to send me
As sick as I'm getting
They'll stick me in a conventional oven
With a rotisserie setting and won't even notice me sweating
Shit, I done made a verse, said some foul shit
Tryna go back fix it, fucked around, and just made it worse
Yeah, I'm back, looking no worse for wear
Got these haters mad enough to rip off their hair
And start punchin' the air
Panties so in a bunch that they can't function
It's Shady and Royce, fuck yeah! What a dysfunctional pair!
So stop actin' like a punk, get a pair!
Take a pill and fall the fuck out, spill your lunch in the chair!

[Verse 7: Mr. Porter]
Look, I'm sick, somebody better get the Dimetapp
Who I gotta shoot just to prove that I can rap?
People ask where my shine is at
I say check the liner notes, I done done all kinda crap
I am so much of a star, bitch
That I can fart and piss on the red carpet
Look, my bank account's retarded
My debit card's got a helmet and a harness
Hey, meet demands, but they all are harmless
At shows my riders always the largest
I need four pounds of fried poultry carcass
And red M&Ms chartered from Charlotte
Look, and if you try to act dumb and start shit
I just yell at 'em, like, ""I'm the artist!""
Infected — you know the deal
If you wanna play sick, we can all get ill
Look, measles, mumps
I made you bitches, I don't need you chumps
Y'all got cheese and I need my chunks
Hurry up, so I can go to burn rubber
And get some more dunks

[Verse 8: Royce da 5'9""]
Now, if your attitude determines your latitude
This house that we call hip-hop, I'm in the attic, fool
A mic and two turntables, fit for the unstable
Converted to a padded room
Keep a street sweeper; in fact, I call the mag a broom
You seein' beef, seein' things
You musta had yourself a bag of shrooms
I make a call, make 'em fake a fall
My clique is too sick, say goodbye
In the streets where the stakes is high, like Ruth's Chris
I'm from the city of true shit
Where the mayor went to jail
For bein' a player right after Proof split
Levels the head of competitors, Royce that
I'm drinkin' everyday
'Til Hex Murda get his regular voice back
Ras, I got ya, look scared at ya, blast from ya
From a block away; ask Tricky, I'm that niggie
I'm more hooder than black Dickies
I rap like committin' suicide
In the booth, takin' the track with me
Patrón's in my chromosomes
In order to leave it alone, you have to ween me off
That Lorena Bobbitt chopper will knock a weenie off
Put your body between chalk
I'm squeezin' the 9 iron, like I'm swingin' golf
I'm with the best rapper alive, put somethin' on it
Your sound's plain as a cheeseburger with nothin' on it

[Verse 9: Eminem]
I'll do a hundred-yard dash just to slash Kim Kardash'
In the ass with a shard of glass from Nick Hogan's car crash
You may look like the passenger for that, don't be a smartass
Yeah, laugh while you sit there
Thinkin' that the hard part passed
You ain't seen pain 'til Leatherface flips mane
I'll cut your fuckin' balls off, homie, my saw's off the chain
I chopped the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs
And the top half of the torso fuckin' crawled off insane
I ain't seen shit like that since I went to Mike Jack's
Took the Elephant Man's skull, fucked it, and put it right back
Handed my dick to Bubbles
While he sucked it and licked my nut sack
Gave him a reach-around
While I fucked him right in his butt crack
Nah, I ain't takin' it back, faggot, fuck that!
I give a fuck about nothin', so here's where you fucked up at
Don't go touchin' that can
Man, you don't wanna open up that
Wait a min, ah, shit… Alchemist, cut that!"

Big Weenie

[Intro]
I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean, mean man

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 1]
Alright, listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make yoo-hoo? Pippity-kaka-poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question, why do I always sense this undeniable tension?
From the moment that I enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 2]
Alright now I (Shit), I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again, you idiot, no, I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without looking at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay? You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
A bunch of sweets or something? What, you munch a bunch of Crunch 'n Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
""Yes, I do, sir, what am I on?"" You, sir, are on truth serum
""Marshall, I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
Evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities""

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 3]
Alright, now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, wanna check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How 'bout now? What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying, there's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why are you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this? This is torturous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just as...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Outro]
Fuck off my dick"

Favorite Bitch

[Intro: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
Nah, for real, you know what I'm sayin'? Like
Like music's my first love, right?
But what it turned into is like
You know, these, these cats got it now, she just like a ho
(They ain't doin' it now to make music)
You know what I mean? (Yeah)
It's not real (Yeah)
Switched it up, then everybody—
Done changed the shit on that damn—
Yeah, everybody done ran through it
Mumble rappin'
Ain't no more substance in shit
Right, right
They don't treat it the way it needs to be treated
I kinda want that old thing back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yeah, I was young, I was hungry
I was chasin' the bag at twenty-one, I was lucky
To find an unеaten fucking (What?) honeybun I forgot about
Now I got money fallin' out, fiftiеs, hundreds, and twenties (Twenties)
And I know nothing is funny 'bout the Manchester bombing
But we got something in common (What?), both of us are alarming
Foul, disgusting, and awful (Yeah), so repugnant and ugly (Yup)
I could give the Boston Marathon a run for its money, yeah
And you could say I'm a little bit immature
But this type of literature got me a little richer
But I get insecure when them other dudes hit on you, girl
You're letting 'em fiddle with your clitoris
Remember you were my fucking—

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
You used to be my favorite, bitch
Things'll never be the same, ain't it funny how you changed
Up and flipped the script?
You done let a bunch of lames fall through and go plain
That I can't permit
You ain't have to do it like that, told you I'd be right back
Look what you did, I need a new chick
Like the music, I have to bounce on my favorite, bitch

[Verse 2: Eminem, Eminem & Ty Dolla $ign]
Always hated my smile
Mama told me it's goofy
I'd get picked on at school
Come home and she'd school me
She never sugarcoated it to me
She said if I wasn't so stupid and ugly, I wouldn't always get bullied (True)
I think of my struggles (Yeah) and get emotional
Could be 'cause how behind the eight-ball and far in the hole that they put me
Now I'm on a roll like a Tootsie (Yeah)
I'm just trollin' you pussies
But I'm like a stroller 'cause you'll see just how I roll if you push me
But that's what I do this music for
When I was goin' through some of the hardest times, I drew from her
But she's like the devil 'cause I just can't let loose of her (Lucifer)
'Cause the thought of losin' her makes me wanna just let loose on her
Then I hit the studio, tryna rendezvous with her
Tell her, ""It's a butt-dial girl,"" yeah, booty call (Haha)
That's how it used to be, 'cause you and me, we ruled the world
And we made Curtis blow (Kurtis Blow, 50)
Fuck, I miss them days

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
You used to be my favorite, bitch
Things'll never be the same, ain't it funny how you changed
Up and flipped the script?
You done let a bunch of lames fall through and go plain
That I can't permit
You ain't have to do it like that, told you I'd be right back
Look what you did, I need a new chick
Like the music, I have to bounce on my favorite, bitch

[Interlude: Eminem]
You fuckin' leavin' me, bitch?
I don't think so, sit your motherfuckin' ass down
I swear to God, you run to that door
I'ma put one in the back of your fuckin' head
Now I'ma ask you this one time
And your answer better be ""Yes""

[Verse 3: Eminem & Ty Dolla $ign]
Would you marry me again
Now that everything has changed? (Yeah)
It'll never be the same (Nah)
As the era whence we came (Who?)
From Nas to Pac, Ra, (Yeah), Eric B. and Kane (I know)
But I know a few from this era that are lyrically insane
And although most are never gonna hit the level Cole or Weezy at
Or be emotionally attached to Yo! MTV Raps (Yeah)
Runnin' home from school to catch an episode, the feeling that
It gave you to rip the plastic off the tape you're holdin'
Peel it back, yeah, tear it off, and play it (What?)
And swear to God, four o'clock
We'd crowd around the TV, Butter in his underwear and socks
When Naunie was Kon Artis (Yeah) and Proof had his hair in locs (Doody)
Yeah, back when Flavor Flav had us wearin' clocks
(Back with) Back with Ed Lover (Yeah)
And there was two Dr. Dre's, that's a paradox (Pair of Docs)
But I never thought I'd get so jealous
At the thought of letting you go psychologically
It's gonna bother me, my eyes are already watery
Part of me don't wanna stop (Yeah) 'til I get you back
If I gotta put the work in and tell you I'm never givin' this up
Other part wants to tell you just to get fucked
Go back to whatever dick that you sucked (Ah)
Get back together with them, you slut
Givin' up the vagina like a trip to the gynecologist
When I helped you become bigger than you were
But I guess that it slipped your mind, you must be biding your time
Looking for someone to come along that'll make you feel like I did back when you were mine, huh? (Damn)
But truthfully, it was never really you and me exclusively
And there's too many new MC's you can choose between
But no matter how many motherfuckers ran through it, they can't do it like me
But I can't keep burnin' the candle at both ends
And I can't handle it when I leave and you find another one
Now I gotta take this beat and dismantle it
I won't grieve when I kill you
But if I can't have you, bitch, nobody can
Can't believe I used to be your favorite, bitch"

We As Americans

[Intro]
There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone line: can't dial out (Shit!)
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

[Verse 1]
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail, but this time
When I get pulled over there's a Doberman Pinscher
And a pit bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit
Foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 2]
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President [dead]
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been ""Bastard"", the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack (*click*)

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 3]
(Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans"

Call it toilet paper, yeah, flush with cash
Girl, nice butt, is it up for grabs?
Just wanna touch your ass, is that too much to ask? Yeah
I made a grip, I know it's tough to grasp, get the bag
Call it potato chips, I stuff in duffel bags
On some public transportation shit, 'cause I will bus' your ass
Fuck the chain, I'm off the trailer hitch, I got a bunch of swag

Girl, your man is a nincompoop, a symptom
Of a simp 'cause he'll spend some loot to get some
As for me, I'm the Kim Jong-Un of pimps, hon' (Haha)
Swag dripping, I'm in a pub
Went up to this chick who was so tipsy, we went to hug
Ended up tripping, I picked her up
She yelled out it's her birthday
She's fifty and in the club
Then it comes on (Yeah), that ""In da Club"" song (Yeah)
She's a buzzsaw (What?), we're goin' numbskull (Uh)
I live on the edge (Haha), she's a jump off (Yeah)
Call her Cinderella (Why?), she loves balls (Oh)

Attack like the Ripper
All over the track doin' laps like a stripper
Now (Now), now (Now), w— wow (Wow) look out (Out)
Rap circles around ('Round) clowns, surround sound (Sound)
John Rambo's back and my ammo's stacked
And I'm cocking raps, I'm on your head
Other words, I'm stocking caps and I'm talking facts (Fax)
Like OfficeMax
Never down, I'll be up like an insomniac
Girl, I got racks you got a rack
How you got all that back and no body fat
I'm in awe with that
When I stopped the Pontiac at the laundromat that I saw you at
You almost had a heart attack, went into cardiac
You ran inside and told your boyfriend like, ""I'll be back""
But for all you knew I probably act like I'm Daniel Wozniak
I'm a psycho-pa-pathic killer
I'm a cap peeler, caterpillar
With the botanic of bananas
You never heard better vernacular
Comin' after your scapula
For the lack of a better word, Dracula
'Cause I'm attackin' a rapper at the phrenic nerves
I'm a savage, back to put the dagger in the back of competitors
Predator and scavenger
I am a carnivore and a baller, you're at the dollar store
What the fuck you got a wallet for? Y'all are poor
I was livin' in squalor but, uh-uh, not no more
Now I'm the one they holla for
Fuckin' shit up like a dinosaur in a China store
Bitch, I'm number five (What?) minus four (Haha)

[Chorus]
Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny

Foolish Pride

[Intro: Eminem & Manix]
Yo man, yo Marsh, man
Yo, you've been kickin' all this shit about yourself
What of the homies, man?
Oh you want one about the posse? Alright

[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride

[Verse: Eminem]
Well, foolish pride has a lot of things to say
You got foolish pride, like you got tooth decay
But tooth decay is another problem
So let's take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it
Now, when I talk about foolish pride
I mean blacks and whites taking different sides
When blacks and whites take different sides
Unity never happens, and we will subside
We will subside and hatred will release
And everything will just crush that peace
But when we crush that peace, you see we start hatin' each other
But remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister
Just like I'm a mister
I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her
I kissed her, I placed it on her cheek
And she didn't come back 'til next week
Now it was next week and she was back again
Wanting to kiss a white kid
So she was my girlfriend, we started going out
But that's okay because we were black and white
Blacks and whites sometimes mix
But black girls only want your money 'cause they're dumb chicks
So I'ma say like this
Don't date a black girl, take it as a diss
If you want, but if you don't
I'ma tell you like this, I surely won't
Never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
And that shit ain't funny
So I'ma say, ""Look, honey
Why do you do this?
You know, you step up to me like you a Brutus
Then you try to grab my spinach
Because it's green and that's cash
So get outta here, 'cause I don't need your ass""
I said that before, but that's okay because, like I said, you're a whore
Black girls and white girls just don't mix
Because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
White girls are good, I like white girls
I like white girls all over the world
White girls are fine and they blow my mind
And that's why I'm here now telling you this rhyme
'Cause black girls, I really don't like
We don't mix, it's like riding a bike
When you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
You know it's kinda hard and that's why I say to you
I'm giving you a little advice
Don't date a black girl, if you do it once, you won't do it twice
You won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
And that ain't funny
So I'ma say, ""Look, honey""
I've already said that before
But like I said again you're nothing but a big whore
So when Mike catch on the bass line
That's okay 'cause we will not just waste time
I'll get straight to the point, black girls are bitches
That's why I'ma tell you, you better pull up your britches
'Cause all that cash is making your ass drag
From the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad
I mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy
And then you turn around and fuck another big black guy
Now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
But that's okay because you need a god damn spanking
From me, the funky M&M
I'm busting rhymes and I'm swallowing phlegm
I'm busting a freestyle just like this
I say, ""swallowing phlegm"" and Howard gets pissed
But when Howard gets pissed that's okay
Because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
So I'll just worry about that problem when I come to it
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it
'Cause— I forgot the chorus
But that's okay 'cause y'all saying, ""Bust a rhyme for us""
So I'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl
She turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
A wack girl, because black girls ain't funny
All they want is your goddamn money
They take you for everything you've got
And then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand
So I'ma kick it to you just like this
How does the chorus go? I forgot
But that's okay, 'cause I'ma tell you in stride
I'ma say, ""Ole foolish pride""

[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Date a white girl, 'cause they got the raw hide"

Quitter (Everlast Diss)

[Part I: Quitter]

[Intro 1: Eminem]
Yo, I dedicate to this to you
To all my fans, keeping y'all in health
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself
'Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart condition and
Which I create, 'cause that's my mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this type of fag claims to never be gay

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I knew you was jealous from the day that I met you
I upset you, 'cause I get respect, I bet you
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you
Peckerwood mad 'cause his record went wood
No respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood
And said, ""Heck, country western rap records are good""
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year
Then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere
It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year
No one's tryin to hear some fucking old fart in a chair
Sittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear
So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea
Figure you can diss me to jump start your career?
I punch you in your fucking chest 'til your heart kicks in gear
And fuck your underground buddies' nameless crew
Like I'mma say they names so they can be famous too

[Hook 1: Eminem]
You just a Quitter and you bitter 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you
You just a quitter and you bitter 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke
To the rap you wrote, your fuckin' answer back's a joke
And I'mma tell these motherfuckin' fans the truth
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you
You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you
Like I ain't notice you, bitch, I had a show to do
Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you
You better shut your fuckin mouth while you O-for-two
Back in '94 Limp opened the show for you
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
Took your motherfuckin' DJ and stole him too
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
Confused as fuck 'cause now your music sucks dick
Mr.-Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap quicker
But never last, and Everlast is a

[Hook 1: Eminem]
Quitter and you bitter 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you
You just a quitter and you bitter 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Aight look, so this is what we ask of our fans
If you ever see Everlast, whoop his ass
Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him
Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a hoe, bitch-slap him
Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp
Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid
Do it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it
He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin
Shit, in five years we'll all be eatin' at Whitey's
And he'll be bussin tables in that bitch, cleanin the toilets

[Interlude 1: Eminem]
Ayo, fuck this, cut this shit off
Ayo Head
That's why I fucked your mother, you fat motherfucker

[Part II: Hit 'Em Up (Remix)]

[Intro 2: Eminem]
Kill Whitey (Hahaha!)
Kill Whitey, Detroit
Kill Whitey, yo, yo
Kill Whitey, haha, look

[Verse 4: Eminem]
First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay
You claim to be a Muslim, but you Irish White
So fuck you, fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight
Plus, I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford, 40 and white, lethargic ass dickhead
I keep 'em comin' while you runnin' out of breath
Steady duckin' while I'm punchin' at your chest, you need to rest
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
With your three CDs nobody sees, when they released
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MCs
You ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks
I let you faggots know it's on for life
But Everlast might die tonight, haha!
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know

[Hook 2: Eminem]
Grab .380s when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute, honkey, I hit 'em up

[Interlude 2: Eminem]
Hahaha
Yo', check this out
You faggots ain't even on my level
I'mma let D12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Yo, get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Whitey Ford's heart just stopped
Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack
Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin' back
Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are
At your own restaurant, while I'm servin' ya
Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops
Call the cops, I'mma beat your ass while they watch

[Verse 6: Kuniva]
Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin' fun of you Erik
Where's your House of Pain now? It's only one of you Erik
You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round
With some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfuckin' Belle Isle Bridge

[Hook 2: Eminem]
Grab .380s when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute, honkey, I hit 'em up

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
This ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin' killed
With his chest open, tryin to throw a fuckin' punch
But you just chokin', having a stroke
And now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
'Cause you suck, motherfucker, you should learn to rhyme
Talkin' about you packin' pistols, but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale
On his way to fuckin' prison, pistol whippin' tail
Erik, remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
That shit was obvious, you probably was gay
Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop
49,000 copies the week your shit drop
While my sales making records break
Two and a half million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker, I hit em up

[Verse 8: Proof]
I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music, we got a Uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated, you violated
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
Erik's irons get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches get your throats cut

[Verse 9: Swifty]
What the fuck, is you stupid? I choke Whitey Ford
With his fucking guitar cord and stuff him in cardboard
Chopped up in a box, with 16 parts, I stomped on his heart
D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaurant locked and block your door
'Cause we hit 'em up like motherfuckin 2Pac Shakur

[Verse 10: Eminem]
You a, Black Jesus, heart attack, seizures
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
White devil, washed-up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country

[Outro: Eminem]
Yo, ayo cut this shit off
Sheeeit! Fuck him!
That's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done
That's it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise
I just believe in kicking a man while he's down
Goddamn! I quit!
Mention my daughter's name in a song again, you fucking punk Ayo!"

Old Time’s Sake

[Intro: Eminem]
Good evening
This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of
Four million and a half.. feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please... undo your seat belt for takeoff (chkk)
You are now free to smoke about the cabin (chkka)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm Dre, from back in the day
From N.W.A, from black and the gray
From choking a bitch, to smacking her face
From stacking up bodies, to racking AKs up
From racking up hits, to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry, and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happenin' in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, as far as competition, faggot, there ain't none

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Speak of the Devil, it's attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

[Chorus: Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smoking with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smoking with the best)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen; say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin
Vinn-vinn, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

[Chorus: Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Now where there's smoke, there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Nuh-uh, he ain't playin'
He's gon' get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane, vodka and creatine
Hpnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake

[Verse 6: Dr. Dre]
Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you're smokin' with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rollin' shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smokin', you just holdin' shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off of puffing them trees

[Verse 7: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up, Cheech
Come on, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady, man, come on back—What?
Man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck!
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn, bitches!)
Dre, it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just—

[Chorus: Eminem]
Give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)"

Buffalo Bill

[Intro]
Ahh! You sick asshole, let me go
Somebody please! Help!
Oh my God, please help me! Oh
""It fits perfect""

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Better watch out, sucker, now I got you where I want ya
Onslaught coming and I'm packing in my lunch-a
Bunch of missile launchers and a bunch of contra–
Band, van full of ganja, now come on, jump
Man, stop moshin' Marshall; oh my God, ya
Doing the cha-cha and the Cucaracha with a quadra–
Plegic, boogying down to Frank Sinatra
Lindsay to the Lohan, lick it while you let me watch ya
Who'da knew the Buddha'd do to me what it's done?
Such cynicism when there’s izm in my system
Blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lips, son
So much on my hands, I got to give my kids a fist bump
Christo–pher Reeves swimmin' in my swim trunks
""Mister – Help me"" is what he said to me and then sunk
Women, skinning them and cutting them up in chunks
In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin, once

[Chorus]
Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Always, you can see him lurkin' in the hallways
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawl space
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place?
Hide 'em in the wall, well, how long will the drywall take?
Well, fuck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait
Until it dries, for the moment, I guess you're all safe
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling
You can even hear the evil spirits coming from within
Someone's in the back of my damn house, rummaging
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin
Vinn, on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you trying to fight? You will never win
Severin' legs, arms; damn, there goes another limb
Pull the lever then; trap door, death is evident

[Chorus]
Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothin', so chill
Fuckin' ho, you better fuckin' hold still
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill
Cut 'em, gut 'em, and just get to stuffin' those girls
Man, I think she had enough of those pills
Sedate her, then I wait, I come back later
Just-a clutching those steel
Blades, baby, when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!
I keep hearing voices like
""Wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
And push it right through her
While you put ya shish kebab skewers into her
Barbecue her, would you do to her what you usually do
To a girl whose skin's newer?""
(In a world of sin you are, this is turning into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are)
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya
Boo-yah! Who ya think you're fucking with?
Duck, because here he comes again

[Chorus]
Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill"

Never Enough

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You gon' say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy – you payin' attention, boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it, bag it or chop it
It'll get you high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot, your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough"

Can I Bitch

[Intro]
(I, I wanna grow up too)
""Uncle Marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?""
Here we go!

[Verse 1]
Now, once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came, and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper-wood
So these silly little fans, they were misled
By a nerdy Internet computer hip-hop head
""Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash.""
""Grab this silver paint and just paint my ass.""
Hey, mister, would you care to bear witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister?
Stanibus, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the ""Mr
Not-Havin'-It,"" it's the Mad, sinister
Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonistic faggot
Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!

[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

[Verse 2]
Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me, for a second, and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin' when
All of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit
It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
You respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
The fourth letter: ""Slim, you're really startin' to upset me.""
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryna kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A!
This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
Right away, I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre
""We got a bogey,"" ""Marshall, I'm on the way.""

[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

[Verse 3]
So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib
Only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
""Shit. Oh, Dre, wait a minute, that's it!
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
We can fly over the border!"" ""Let's Go!"" [whoosh]
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed
""What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri.""
""Fuck it,"" keep goin', no time to waste
""Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case.""
""Okay,"" fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
""Oh well, only thirty more thousand miles!""
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryna conversate
Just tryna find a reason for the constant hate
And tryna figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'
""He couldn't have fell off that hard."" Ain't no way!
What happened to the way you was rappin'
When you was scandalous?
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist!
Plus, he raps with his regular voice
[Four impacts] ""What was that?"" ""Pet Shop Boys.""
So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted
And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin'—Christ!
He won't die! This guy's like a battered wife!
He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back, I cracked his jaw
Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch
Do something! At least one punchline!
Come on! 'Til the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-
Ty nine percent of my fans are blond!
'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!
Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs!
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again
""Compton!"" ""Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!""
""Stomp him!"" ""Switch feet!"" ""Stomp him!"" ""Switch again!""
""Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!
I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again!"" (""Ahh!"")
""Damn,"" ""He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!""

[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch"

The Sauce

[Intro]
It's all bad now, man, it's all bad
But y'all done fucked up now
Yeah! Haha! New shit!
Ayo, I just want the whole world to know
That I did not start this, but I will finish it

[Verse]
Comin' up, it never mattered what color you was
If you could spit, then you could spit
That's it, that's what it was
Back when motherfuckers was straight backpackin'
Cipherin', fightin' for life in this rap
For the mic to get passed, and you psyched and you gassed
Then you hype, ‘cause you last
And you might whoop some ass; if you lost, then you lost
Shake hands like a man and you swallowed it
When the Unsigned Hype column in
The Source was like our only source of light
When the mics used to mean somethin', a four was like
You were the shit, now it's like the least you get
Three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
Four and a half or five means you're Biggie, Jigga, Nas
Or Benzino—shit, I don't even think you realize
You're playin' with motherfuckers' lives
I done watched Dre get fucked on The Chronic
Probably ‘cause I was on it
Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin' breath to get a five
Shit, I was right, I'da fuckin' died already tryin'
I swear to God, I never lie, I bet that's why
You let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit, we knew
You'd probably try and fuck us with Obie and 50 too
*Spit* Fuck a relationship! We through!
No more Source to street cred, them days is dead
Ray's got AK's to Dave Mays's head
Every issue there's an eight-page Made Men spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid of this fuckin' waste of lead
On my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple
So, listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This old G's about to get smoked like rolled weed
You don't know me or my motherfuckin' mother
You motherfuckin' punk!
Put me on your fuckin' cover just to sell your little sell-out mag
I ain't mad, I feel bad, here's an ad
Here's a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit
That you don't know about, yeah?
Let's talk about how you're puttin' your own son out there
To try to eat off him because you missed your boat
You're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old
No wonder you're sore now, lordy, you're bored now
I'm pushin' 30, you're kickin' 40's door down
Bitch, this is war now, and you'll never beat me
All you do is cheat me out of Quotables
But you know that you'll always see me on your TV
‘Cause you've got to stay up 'til three in the morning
To see your video played once on BET
So, hee hee hee, who has the last laugh? Aftermath, yeah
So, on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks
We'll never fold or hold back
Just know that Benzino's wack; no matter how many times I say his name, he'll never blow, jack
You're better off tryin' to bring RSO back
Look at your track record, that's how far it goes back
It's extortion, and Ray owns a portion
So, half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from Boston
Bullyin' and bossin' Dave like a slave
They completely brainwashed him, and forced him to stay
Locked in his own office
Afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in New York
And it's pitiful, ‘cause I would have never said shit if you'd
Have kept your mouth shut, bitch, now what?
Hit it, Clue! Spit it, Slay! New shit, Exclusive
Yo, Lantern, yo Whoo Kid
You know what to do with this
Use it, I'm through, this is stupid
I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this
And who you callin' a bitch, bitch? You owe me!"

313

[Hook: Eye-Kyu & Eminem]
Now, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one, see
Man, what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one, see

[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Yo, some people say I'm whack, now if that's right I'm
The freshest whack MC that you ever heard in your lifetime
My slick acapella sounds clever with the beats, boy
I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forget a gold digger's succubus
My soul's thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke: can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more different strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your woman
Just to keep my lyrics comin' (bitch)
We elevated to new heights, premeditated
Let it be that I stated, they hate it
Now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it, that's the reason I'm hated
To represent's my temperament
If rap was a dick, all you so called hard MCs would not be impotent, but pimpin' it
And actin' like you could rock a show
Harder than LL's rock the bells, and you's a ho
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep comin'
Like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah, I got somethin' for your ass to hate
I blast your hate, and have you all runnin' past the gates
And as for face clutchin' and touchin' the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Buckin' these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leavin' them hot and bothered, turned on, like an appliance
Defiance? No, we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well, I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singin' or gonna do a thing but run
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own
With the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So, stop that bullshit flow, yo
You need to come with the real skills and act like you know

So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one, see

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
You don't know shit, so when you see one, flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain round the block to jog your fuckin' memory
It's either them or me, man, kill or be killed
Your will'll be sealed, your casket closed, you still'll be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's actin' soft and he cowers, he better come cleaner
Than Jeru jackin' off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite
And wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang, simple as ABCs
Skip over the Ds and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MCs, and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome, like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, biters get treated with shots
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands
If they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours, let's see what you got
But don't front, and never try to be what you're not
'Cause you can be quick
Jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't jack

[Hook: Eye-Kyu & Eminem]
Now, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one, see
Man, what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one, see"

8 Mile: The Lunch Truck Battle

[Vanessa (Miz-Korona)]
Man, I’m gettin' so sick and tired of fuckin' with this steel
They only give us 30 minutes to eat lunch and chill
My body achin' just to get a buck
I’m sick of eatin' this shit off this fuckin' lunch truck
Nasty-ass food, I’m in a nasty-ass mood
I should’ve called in sick, shit, I had somethin' to do

[Mike (Xzibit)]
I can’t believe that I’m hearing all this ravin' and rantin'
From Vanessa up in here at the New Detroit stampin'
You need to get your food and take your ass back to work
You're dreamin' if you think them corny-ass raps will work
Look at y’all standin' out here, freezin' like dumb fucks
Rappin' away for food off this ragedy lunch truck
Who want what? Who pumped up to get rolled up?
I spit venom in every direction, soak some up
Look at this fat-ass nigga, sloppy sucker
You're a ugly motherfucker, your pop should’ve wore a rubber
Stop rhymin', keep your day job, Vanessa
Next time leave that bullshit home on the dresser
Speaking of dresses, take a look at Paul the fruitcake
When you travel you probably pack panties in your suitcase
Made out of lace from Victoria’s secret
If ten men came in a cup you’d probably drink it

[Jimmy (Eminem)]
Okay, folks, enough with the gay jokes
Especially from a gay broke bitch yourself, hey lo'
This guy's a doo-doo
You've worked here longer than me
And I get paid more than you do
Dawg, take a seat
What’s this guy standing in line for? He ain’t got money to eat!
Check this out, yo yo
This guy cashed his whole check and bought one ho-ho
Fuckin' homo! Little maggot
You can’t hack it; Paul’s gay, you're a faggot
At least he admits it, don’t even risk it
This guy's starvin' to death, someone get him a biscuit!
I don’t know what they told you, Mike
You must had them cornrows rolled too tight
This job, you wanna quit, but you can’t
You’ve worked at this plant so long, you're a plant
Look at your goddamn boots!
For Christ sakes, they’re starting to grow roots!
On this mic you get faded
You look like a pissed-off rapper who never made it
And why you fuckin' with the gay guy, G?
When really you're the one who's got the HIV
Man, I’m done with this clown, he's soft
Fuck it, I’ll let homegirl finish you off

[Vanessa (Miz-Korona)]
A guy like you would never get a real woman
You jackass, go jack off; that's the only way you cumin'"

My 1st Single

[Intro]
Oh! Yeah! So much for first single on this one

[Verse 1]
Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out of—erra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Buttersworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason
Other than to—just to tease him
'Cause he was his biggest (*burp*) fan
He used to be Superman, now I'm pourin'
Liquor on the curb in his name for him
""Eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said.""
It goes one for the money, two for the fuckin' show
Ready, get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers, it's dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes
In a safe, locked 'em away (*slam*)
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh, I wish I could've told you to not do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

[Verse 2]
Eri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick, bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and naïve
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory-dickory Dirk Diggler, look at me work wizardry
With these words – am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain
Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it {blblblblblblblb} – wait, let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang
Cameras, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Pornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
When they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em
'Cause they could've sworn someone said, ""Ni—""
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
""Ga-hu"" and then they come to
Find out it was Justin sayin', ""I'm gon—nuh cum!""

[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be. my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

[Verse 3]
Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK
And if someone picks up
You can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay and make up with Ray (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock!
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done, you can fuck off, fuck-a-fuck-off!

[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka (*burp*)"

Low Down, Dirty

[Hook]
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 1]
Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self-inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, ""Bitch, you got a sick kid""
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
""How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?""
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (RRRAH!), killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

[Hook]
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 2]
I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippets, passed out like sampler snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Lace it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the rum
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in

[Hook]
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 3]
My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)
Delinquent, choking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like ""Whoo, this is good! Who sings this?""
""Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit""
It was predicted by a medic, I'd grow
To be an addicted diabetic, living on liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it lives
The closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Set up for these white blue-collared hicks
It's to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
For those who kiss ass and swallow dicks

[Hook]
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

8 Mile: 313 Cypher (Chin Tiki Girls)

[Parking Lot Rapper #2 (Obie Trice)]
I use my voice to spit the fiery frame
Try and refrain, dying in vain
Soon as I reply [?]
I be the nigga in the Shelter who be eyeing your chain

[Parking Lot Rapper #3 (Njeri Earth)]
313 area, bound to bury ya with vengeance
My rhymes sentences'll put an end to your existence with the rigorousness
Niggas, I'm serious, delirious, cause a curious—pause
The fury calls from my jaws from devouring y'all raw

[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
You forced to listen to the individual, the metaphysical
The Mac Mitten, rhyme ritual, heterosexual
Syllables they sound complex to you, lines perplexing you
With words that could put a hex on you, snap that neck on you
Murder you, boil you, we keep a white boy or two
Let my man grab the mic, you see how Bunny Rabbit do

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Your style is generic, mine's authentic made
I roll like a renegade, you need clinic aid
My technique's bizarre and ill; I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
As I proceed to cook and grill ya, that’s all it took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You wanna battle? You beat around the bush
Like you're scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push, someone that I can bully
Wait a minute, I don’t think you understand fully
See me without a style's like mustard without the Heinz
I lead the new school, you're a Busta without the rhymes
I crush the shit out your line

[Sol George (Omar Benson Miller)]
Now I'm the Rashiki smoking the lick licky
Ten freaky girls inside The Chin Tiki
Girl, when you see me you better believe me
This ain't a game and pimping ain't easy
Anything goes when it comes to hoes
I'm the kingpin when it comes to flows
You better ask someone if you don't know
When you see me girl, say what up doe
Ten freaky girls, ten, ten, ten freaky girls"

2.0 Boys

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9""]
Ryan's a homicidal misfit, I write the solution of biophysics
On the side of a cliff in some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violent psychotic wit
Devour, polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writing, but I will stick this pencil in your ass
Before I write your shit, pause, inhaling hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, going door-to-door
Like we selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch a dancer, I'm about as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you'd probably rip your pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me Anchorman, I hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water, then go and drown a fish
Fuck, I'm fucking heinous, I make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you saying?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
FUCK! It's fucking raining, SHIT! There's lightning, BITCH!
It's thundering cause I'm cussing up a storm if you wondering, SHIT!
SHIT! You couldn't muster up enough thought
To take a dump during a brain fart, chump
If you want urine in your face, all you had to do was say
That you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, Illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us, your squad's gotta be
Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
Soon as we rolled up on these hoes, all's we know
Is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fucking the dog before we start calling YOU Bizarre
Shit, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull
Fell in love with the shih-tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
And this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffing, fuck a ball sack
If the taints can't take you on a date, you mistake me for a gentleman
You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain't, I'm the bad guy
Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees gets a black eye

[Chorus: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
This game is over

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Puffin' loosies, watching ""I Love Lucy"" with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? I'm Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
'Til then I kill the bad man trying to slay me
Everything you kick weak, your spit kung fughesi
All my homeboys, 2.0 Boys
Nickel, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain't got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moiss
Bang bang, bang bang, House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write until my right arm veins sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that? Yaowa, you know who finna fall out
Definitively finish you, my fist take out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Jets and movers, cesspoolers, meth abusers
You step to us, text Rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to Nayhood, big in the 'jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without rigging the deck
So I'm well-prepped if you just want war
There will be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, you keeping acting like you don't know Mouse, nigga
And you going to need the best doctors, House nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face
Talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

[Chorus: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
This game is over

[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Take off, you invited inside of the mind of
A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer)
I'm grinding up rappers are lining up jackers, I'm climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles
(The gold hand) Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I'm a step on you, bring it to your yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

[Verse 6: Yelawolf]
I got Jim Beam in the liver, getting head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker
Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pump will stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fucking ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging
I'm a freak shows at the county carnival, then you paying
Bitch, I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling ""Go Shady!"" Driving slower than an old lady
In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain't fucking with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't want to see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then, homie, I deploy game over

Yo, I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
Game over!"

Get You Mad

[Intro: Eminem]
Yo, mic-check (My dick)
Testing, one, two, fuck (My dick)
My nuts

[Verse 1: Eminem]
My attitude is worse than N.W.A's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit
And diss people who ain't have shit to do with it
Like Cool J does (My tattoo)
You see me standin' outside of your buildin'
Screamin', ""Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children""
I look at my life in a new light
Fuck it, give me two mics
I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You probably hear me rap half-hearted
'Cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryna get my porno career started (Oh, hell yeah)
Every place and event, been there, done that
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
Want a deal? Study these five chapters
Lesson 1, throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson 2, face 'em and diss 'em (What up, dawg?)
Don't give 'em a demo, kidnap 'em
(Come on, you're comin' with me, motherfucker, check this out)
And make 'em come to your basement and listen
Lesson 3, get a job at a label
Switch demos with Canibus and put yours on the owner's table
(Here, listen)
Lesson 4, know you heard this before
""Hey, let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow for sure""
Don't act like a fan, you wanna get signed
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can (Hey dude, come here)
Lesson 5, get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't givin' you shit, bitch, don't even bother askin' me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin', like Master P (Ungh)
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea
And all three of my main girls said, ""See ya""
'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in
And caught me fuckin' Aaliyah
I splish-splash while I'm takin' a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break 'em in half, take 'em and laugh
White trash, fuckin' your wife in the ass
While you're out siphonin' gas
For your lawn mower to cut the grass

[Chorus: Eminem]
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
(Yo, why you diss me?)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had
(A big dick)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad (Nurse, nurse)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

[Verse 2: Eminem]
What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi, Renée (Oh, hi)
I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away (What?)
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?
Blood drippin' from it
Rippin' your stomach like a paper mâché
You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill, though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe
Snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage
And sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here)
The demon is here, I'm steamin' this year
I rip ********* voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick, bitch, it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
""Yeah, I don't think this guy is well""
I'm high as hell, I'll beat you with a live cat
When I'm swingin' him by his tail
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin', lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off, then sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured
And stiffer than Christopher Reeves
I was dealing with strep throat
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip?)
Wakin' up the next day in breathing machines
Flashin' back to bein' shot and repeating the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and Pac joke

[Chorus: Eminem]
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

[Outro: Eminem & Sway]
I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (Uh-huh)
That's right, Slim Shady (Yup)
Sway and Tech, sprayin' wreck (Bitch)
And we don't give a heck (Uh-uh)
Or a damn or a fuck or a shit
So suck my mothafuckin' dick
The Wake Up Show, let me tell you what it mean to me
It mean hard beats, hard rhymes, B-boys
Hip-hop, baby, all the way, forever"

She Loves Me

[Intro]
She loves me, she loves my knot
Not for who I am, but what I got, yeah
And I don't wanna blow up her spot
But da-na-na, na-na, da-naa (Woo)

[Verse 1]
Lady, I been watchin' you from the back every time that you walk past
Hate to put you on blast but you got a bomb ass (Yeah)
Been checkin' you out ever since the second you
Stepped in through Naunie's dressing room, girl, you're stunning, I'd bet that you'd
Zap me if I was next to you, sparks'll fly, I expect 'em to
I'd be shocked if they didn't, 'cause you're Carmen Electra-cute (Cutie)
And those ain't just sound effects
I knew something was special soon as we swapped info, I knew that

[Chorus]
She loves me, she loves me not
For who I am, but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (Aha)
She loves me (One more time)
I said, 'cause she loves me (She loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (She loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not
She loves me

[Verse 2]
Sorry I missed your call again, I be in the studio usually
But tomorrow afternoon for me'd work beautifully
If your schedule's open, you say, ""That's cool with me
But you stood me up twice, Slim, you're 0-for-2 with me""
'Cause like a basket, you've been going through hoops for me
Well, if the ball's in my court, why don't we shoot for three?
Yeah, I'll pick you up and we'll cruise through the D
And as soon as we hung up, I'm like, ""Woo""

[Chorus]
'Cause she loves me (She loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (She loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (Aha)
She loves me (Ayo, lemme do this bridge right quick)

[Bridge]
She pulls me close and whispers to me, oh-oh
Lies in my ear, but that's all I wanna hear
That's okay, long as we both know this is all it is, woah
She can have my love for as long as we both are here

[Verse 3]
We're back in my spot now (Yeah), the music is loud, so (What?)
I turn the boombox down (Shh), we cut off our cell phones
You're killin' me soft now, wanna hit it like Balboa
'Cause girl, you're a knockout, your body is out cold (Out cold)
(Woo) I put the moves on you like a U-Haul
Bend you over the foosball table, your shoes fall
To the floor, but canoodlin', I'm not in the mood for
Gotta get me out of these drawers if you wanna (want a) spoon, doll (Yeah)
But before we get to droppin' these drawers, there's options to explore
We can fuck in the closet (Yeah) or on my elevator (Uh)
And maybe when it stops and the door opens
We fall out and we just get off on this floor (Haha)
You say you're falling for me, but not 'cause I'm famous
Then explain to me who that tattoo that's on your leg's of
Girl, your game is an A-plus, but you think I don't notice
Who the screensaver on your damn phone is
It ain't 'cause who I am, bullshit, I like you
Just don't take me for no stupid ass, no disrespect
'Cause even though you're like my truest fan, know it's
Clear you only love me 'cause I'm Superman, Lois, but fuck it

[Chorus]
'Cause she loves me (She loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (She loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not
She loves me (Yeah, one more time)
I said, 'cause she loves me (She loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (She loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (Haha)
She loves me

[Outro]
She loves my knot, haha
I'm just playin', I ain't got no foosball table"

Session One

[Intro: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
Aw, shit! Yeah
You ready to get this shit started or what?
A'ight, well I brought some friends with me too

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin'
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in trouble!
What's occurring befo', after, and during the show
Has no bearing on the bad news I'm bearing, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushing you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fucking feet 'til you get to squishing a ho
It's pandemonium, standing o when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
You should pull over like a sweatshirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Now, homie, who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words, I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed, came back an hour after the accident
And bit a Goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop faking the funk and start shaking your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy I'll fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the lining
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69ing
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house, nigga!
Fuck yo' couch, nigga!
You're screaming, ""Fuck the world!"" with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch know I'm perfectly fit for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear and ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neumann mad cerebral
You on your last burrito!
(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eating
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touching that
Good day and good night, Ortiz, yo, where the fuck you at?

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years
Ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at, a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art of my nice wear
It's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer
Homie, chill, listen, I swear
I'm god, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be? Just waiting to be hooked to IV
As Mumm-Ra's well, when you look at my pee
And this joint (No exception), so just point (A direction)
And record the pig's oink (When I rip his intestines)
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Edimminem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
I'm right here letting the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying
We do it to try to do without tryin'
(Slaughterhouse!) 'Cause to it's us it's so easy
Where's Jumpoff Joe Beezy?"

Alfred (Interlude)

It’s O.K.

[Intro: Proof & Eminem]
Check it out!
Hey, Kyu!

[Hook: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here

[Verse 1: Eminem]
One day I plan to be a family man, happily married
I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried
'Til I'm glad to be buried, and leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be plannin' this stuff
'Cause I'm still strugglin' hard to be the man, and it's tough
'Cause man, it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of
Damaged and scuffed, my hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff, or plan to give up
The minute shit hits the fan, it erupts
I'm antein' up, double or nothin'
I've been troubled enough and
I'm sick of strugglin' and sufferin'
See, my destiny's to rest at ease
'Til I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I see the golden gates to Heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you
When you're steppin' on turf, Kyu

[Hook: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm goin' for broke, gamblin' and playin' for keeps
Every day in the streets, scramblin' and payin' for cheap
Prayin' for sleep, dreamin' with a waterin' mouth
Wishin' for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughterin' house
Caught up in bouts with the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal for these Grants and Jacksons
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always gropin' a mess of flyin' over the nest
To sellin' dope with the rest
I quit smokin' cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Tryin' to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's tryin' to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, runnin' home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Takin' target practice on teens for Starter jackets
I'm usin' smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm tryin' to do well on this Earth
But it's been hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

[Hook: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here"

Drop the Bomb on ’Em

[Intro]
Yeah, boy
Dem better ring the alarm, boy
Dem know what's comin', boy
Buck! Buck! Buck! Haha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh my God, fuckin' bomboclaat
I'm hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, you're nothing but a bra, boy
I'm the real deal, and charbroil her on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch, I'm like Chef Boyardee
In this bitch, send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy, you think you're Tom Sawyer
'Til I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on ya
Fuckin' fictitional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact, boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly-By-The-Seat-Of-His-Pants parasail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearin' zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no, nada
Like your father fuckin' your mother

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me

[Verse 2]
Boy, I'm the Real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids, kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre the steel alloys, the Rap Crown Royals
Who scalp cowboys, now, how that sound for you?
Yeah, boy, you know we're 'bout to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off in the foyer, have a sound voyage
And sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R and marinate in some marinara
And have a Coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar
Of whip-ass on ya, that's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy, boy, them boys, them no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star
Boy, I told you, boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy, fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God, boy, you didn't go there, no, you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got, whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy, Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin', ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot when the bomb drops
Boy, does it drop and when it does, boy, there's a problem

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me

[Verse 3]
Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell, boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin' hell, boy, singin' telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back, better than ever, the cheddar shredder, the grater
The beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin' haters incubators, think you made a mistake
By sayin' Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit? Couldn't agree with you more
If you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady-fuckin'-Aftermath, boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me"

Taking My Ball

[Intro]
Yo, Dre, Man
Make my vocals sound sexy... woo!
Come on, man, come on, man, okay

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm that guy, man, shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut poke holes in ya shirt, jump in mud puddles
While I stomp mudholes in ya ass, girl, now let's cuddle
Blood curdlin', you're gurglin' on your blood, what'll
I do for my next trick? I'm feelin' wonderful
I think I might just do somethin' a little less subtle
Shove a fuckin' Tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador
Of the Valentine's Day Massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her layin' in a blood bath while I
Put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her
In my Spider-Man mask, man
Just imagine the fun I can have with a strap-on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachios? Damn, I'd like to have some
Laying on the patio, man, rolling a fat one
Shady, drop the magic marker, put the cap on
Goddamn, man, are you that much of an asshole?

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm like Houdini, tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make the shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini
Believe me, homie, you don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter
I'm tryna maneuver the Hoover up in your poop chute
Don't move or ya might get it stuck so fuckin' far up in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studio
Now who do ya think is more fruitier?
Wiener smothered in peanut butter, puttin' on a tube of ya
Eye shadow and man, it looked nice, you should've seen it, mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my Visa card
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosey on over to Rosie O'Donnell's with McDonald's
Jump on her lap then watch The Sopranos

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Shady, what are you doin' chewin' on a human?
Grab an aluminum bat, hit Heidi Klum in the back, boom!
And assumin' the fact that that dude's in the back room
Usin' the bathroom, vacuumin' a raccoon
Skewin' a rat, a cat screwin' a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doin' with that broom
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'
Shady, why do you gotta pick on the lady for?
Why you make her read 84 bedtime stories to you in baby talk?
'Cause I'm scared, there's monsters under my bed
Kellie Pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti, dyke? Well, I can pee-pee and write your name

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Outro]
Fine, nobody wants to play with me?
Fuck you then, bitch!
You guys are always mean to me anyways
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gonna make me... make me sad, I'm sad
I'm gonna cry... I'm crying
I'm going to tell my mom... Mom!"

Murder, Murder

[Scratches: DJ Lenn Swann]
""All I see is murder murder, my mindstate""

""All I see is murder murder, my mindstate""
""Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill""
""All I see is murder murder, my mindstate""
""Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate""
""All I see is murder murder, my mindstate""
""Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill""

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash, bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' a MAC
Co-operate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin', ""Freeze!""
But I'm already wanted for sellin' keys
And a bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearin' a vest

[Scratches: DJ Lenn Swann]
""All I see is murder murder, my mindstate""
""Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate""
""All I see is murder murder, my mindstate""

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin' out
Pulled the MAC-10 out
Stuck it in her face: ""Shut your yackin' mouth
'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!""
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Figured, ""Fuck it—mug her while you're there,"" jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and loft it
Out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive, but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', ""Johnny, go in and call the police!
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!""
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores, the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an eighty-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it, I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin', ""truce-truce!""(Don't shoot!)
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

[Scratches: DJ Lenn Swann]
""All I see is murder murder, my mindstate""
""Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate""
""All I see is murder murder, my mindstate""
""Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"""

Hellbound

[Intro: Announcer from Soul Calibur]
Welcome back to the stage of history

(Yo, Slim Shady!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, I'll fuckin', I'll... I'll puke, eat it, and freak you
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to, The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin' to shoot you, I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin' mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet 'til it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showing up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gasses and close it back
With a lit match in it while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments, laugh, roll you, and smoke the ashes

[Hook: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Verse 2: J-Black]
Am I the worst because I never go to church?
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink till my liver rot, see the doc leave the E.R
Then hit a bar for a liquor shot; fuck the liver spot!
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
That I'ma get up and walk, leaving the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain, but it's just to rock
Now if I pray every night
Do I still have to hold my tray very tight?
You feel me, God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearing a North Face
Nickle 9 at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me, but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?

[Hook: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Interlude: Announcer]
Maxi was seriously wounded
But the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch, and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill, like using the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare, ‘cause you fucking with some niggas like this who just don't care

[Hook: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Outro: Announcer]
Time's up! You lose!

Open Mic

[Produced by Mr. Porter]

[Intro]
Hey yo, what's up, man?
Hey yo, you been here all day, man
Y'all been here every weekend, man
I don't ever get a chance to rap first, man!
That's 'cause you wack!
What?!? I ain't wack, nigga, I got some raps for all y'all
Nigga, my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first
You can bust yours after me if you want to
No, no, man, I'm goin' first
I'm gettin' tired of everybody wantin' to go first, man
You always rap first, I'm rappin'
I don't care what none of y'all say; I'm fresh, I'm fresh

[Hook: Thyme]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
""I wanna know, I wanna know""
I said who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
""I wanna know, I wanna know""

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced
When I fill your back with knives
Jackin' life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowin' up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man, so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steamin' like a teapot
I make the D hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazin' task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And win a slug fest, I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse
I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights, I got a match for ya
You couldn't flip shit playin' in toilets with a spatula

[Hook: Thyme]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
""I wanna know, I wanna know""
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
""I wanna know, I wanna know""

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespectin' me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a TEC to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria
Materially, killin' serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache
Wither and break, you slitherin' snake
Gibberin' fake, fibber and flake
I'll twist you in a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
If this is a dream, you wish you can wake
Every diss you can take, personal
We ain't friends tryin' to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take offense
I make intense masterpieces
And smash to pieces your last releases
You pass diseases, that's the reason
I'm showin' you the proper way to
Operate a mic, so pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severin' flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest

[Hook: Thyme]
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
""I wanna know, I wanna know""
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic man
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
""I wanna know, I wanna know""

[Outro: Thyme]
Whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?!
Point him out! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
""I wanna know, I wanna know""
(Ayo, let me get that mic, man)
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic?!
Who the fuck passed you the mic?!

Any Man (Fucking Crazy)

[Produced by Mr. Walt of Da Beatminerz]

[Verse 1]
Hi! Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place, blowed, and sprayed Puffy with mace
I laced the weed with insect repellent, better check to smell it
Eminem starts with E, better check the spellin'
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said ""I'm ready now, bitch! Ain't you feelin' these kicks, cunt?""
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in Hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Hit you in the head with a brick 'til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick 'til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
‘Cause your style is like dying in my sleep; I don't feel it

[Hook]
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Huh?
Is fuckin' crazy – hello, hi!
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

[Verse 2]
I'm ice-grillin' you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed
Full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head
Spasmatic, strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined, jumped up, and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Lookin' Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killin' my girlfriends

[Hook]
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy – listen
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

[Verse 3]
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say
I call in at work, ‘cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excedrin, my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls 'til I shred the skin
""Doctor, check this rash! Look how red it's been!""
""It's probably AIDS!"" ""Forget it then.""
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos
So reach in your billfolds for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
""Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded.""
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it

[Hook]
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy – hello?!
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

[Outro]
Hi, something's not right
I'm sorry, I'm mentally retarded
Slim Shady, I think that's my name
Rawkus Records, fuckin' crazy
Do you hear us? We're fuckin' crazy!
All of us! Hi… bye… goodnight, somethin'"

Demon Inside

[Verse]
I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleeping
I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
The devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
I'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
Door's open and close by themselves
Books fly off shelves, curtains catch fire, the house melts
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple
Two cups of holy water and I'm looking at 'em half full
But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
It got silent, then all these voices said
""Come follow me into the gates of Hell""
I heard 'em yell ""Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!""
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
And told me that's just for starters, Satan'll be in to see me later
To see if I'm interested in being partners"

Stimulate

[Intro]
Psst, hey, listen
La la la la la la la la la laaaa
I love my job
Makes me feel like Superman!
La la la la la la la la la laaaa
Can you fly? I can, wanna see?

[Hook]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see, but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 1]
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics are constantly took outta context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest, I guess
But maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest
Feelin' good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really shoulda fell but I stood, see, I came
Like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark
There's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe, because—

[Hook]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see, but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 2]
My music can be slightly amusin'
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusin'
Just tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid, ain't it? I get sick of tryin' to explain it
See, I could sit and argue with you, but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond
'Cause I came here to uplift, let your woes be gone
Tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly usin'
The Constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuildin'
World revolvin', still evolvin', still Slim
How many kids will copy? Prob'ly millions
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then, 'cause—

[Hook]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see, but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 3]
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
At an alarming rate; common denominate
Add it up and you'll see just why I dominate
I try to stimulate, but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make, ""Slim, you great!""
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but—

[Hook]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see, but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

{Backmasked}
I'm not here to save you
I'm only here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine"

Ridaz

[Intro]
Aw, man, yeah
You ever be in the club, man, you get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You feel like you wanna hit somethin', your fist clenches, you're pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
From splittin' your shit wide open, no stitches can save
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is, I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say, ""Isn't this great?""
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
That's startin' to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene
But it's too late, it's absolute pandemonium, whisked away
In an ambulance is your fate, nothing nobody told you
When you left the house today could've made you anticipate
Such an ass-whipping, okay, 'til the anger dissipates
You'll get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on! (Woo!)

[Chorus]
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

[Verse 2]
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mace 'cause Shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
'Cause if you doubt me, you will, yeah, got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill
Girl, howdy, how do you feel, ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh, hell nah
He must be trying to kill my buzz
I will not budge, so what the deal, ridaz?
Now here they all come and they got your back in, like, two seconds flat
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
'Cause they want in on the act, there's a Cognac bottle
We snuck it in 'cause the beer that they was serving here was only tap
I'm bitin', I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like, ""This guy might hurt me""
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out or go powder your nose, pussy
The louder you yell, the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off, faggot, so now how do you 'spose
We settle it? Hit me in the nose and we'll see how it goes

[Chorus]
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

[Verse 3]
It's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tusslin', the crowd's starting to cheer us and
Adrenaline's rushin' through us just like a geyser gushin'
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm stranglin' your windpipe for nothing (Woo!)
My signature's ligature marks, look at you all
Big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick, it's bizarre
Shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As havin' me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ah
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
In fact, I'll have the crowd smackin' you themselves
Where's D12? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on!

[Chorus]
So, what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

[Outro]
Yeah, what the deal?
I'm feeling hard as hell right now, homie
I almost feel...
Invincible and shit
Aye, Dre!
You got me feeling like
I can't be touched right now, fool, ha!
I'm unstoppable, damn"

[Intro]
Is it your love that's showing?
Life can be free and flowing

[Verse 1]
I'm givin' mad love, I'm snugglin' hugs
Strugglin' thugs, smugglin' drugs
Jugglin' jobs, guzzlin' jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts
We travel in packs, unravelin' facts
And gravel in cracks to find babblin' max, gafflin' tracks
I grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts
Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
Stealin' my art when I sculpt it
The culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat shit
Butterfingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm droppin' naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

[Hook]
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right

[Verse 2]
Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous
Livin' as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this; I'm the rhyme biter, crime fighter
Caped crusader, takin' care of undeservin' lime lighters
I think we live an era meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally
When I stumbled upon his resolution
By usin' a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed
Talkin' that junk like you had Black Bart at your back
Come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
When I rep-a-resent it, and will have a referee in it
Every minute, so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented
Come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it

[Hook]
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right

[Verse 3]
Eminem is headed skyward
For those who thought that I would
Make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas
And showed you all how wack you was
I meant it as a diss
‘Cause you don't posses the pizazz of this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you addin' fuel to the fire; I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical
To my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchantin' rhythm romantically
Freakin' vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here

[Hook]
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight

Remind Me (Intro)

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
Damn, girl
Do I drive you crazy?
You make me crazy, too
You make me do things
I normally wouldn't do
You make me feel things
That I never felt
You gotta be the real thing
’Cause you remind me of myself"

Public Service Announcement 2000

[Announcer: Jeff Bass & Eminem]
This is another public service announcement
Brought to you, in part, by Slim Shady
Tell 'em I don't give a fuck
Slim Shady does not give a fuck what you think
Tell 'em to suck it
If you don't like it, you can suck his fucking cock
Tell 'em they kissed my ass
Little did you know, upon purchasing this album
You have just kissed his ass
Tell 'em I'm fed up
Slim Shady is fed up with your shit
And he's going to kill you
Yeah
A-anything else?
Yeah:
Sue me"

Jimmy Crack Corn

[Intro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Man! Let's go
Hey yo, Fif'!
Yeah?
Call 'em and tell 'em...
It's time to hate us again
We're back!
Haha!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be Black, white, or albino, yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head (*Crash*)
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See, if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keep makin' them tired old threats
A little bit like ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf,"" yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
'Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts, right out the sky, go bad
From out of nowhere, you might just find your career
Come to it, (Eek!) and I'm just like (Oh, yeah!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy's can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention, but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit (Yeah)
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squash it
'Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's like ""Go get 'em""
And I'm just like ""Why you're tryin' to fight momentum?""
We just keep winnin', by landslides, oh, and um
Shady Limited's, in any size yo' denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say ""Our clothing line's on Fiyaa''
Meanwhile, your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I'll just keep fucking you like I fucked her
Right in the ass with K-Y, yes, sir!
So full of joy, boy, am I absurd?
Even Chingy would tell you: ""That boy don't curr""

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy's can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is G-Unit at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)
(Haha!)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Your homie got clapped on, man, I don't care
The cops in my nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is, dawg, man, life's not fair
Your friends should've known not to front 'round here
Listen, kid, where I'm from,  the wolves smell fear
They'll strip your ass of your jewels right here
Man, I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man, you can catch a hot one like outta nowhere
A beautiful day without drama is rare
Your girl's a freak, man, sometimes we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You probably heard about me, I'm a sho nuff player
In the hood politicin', like I'm runnin' for mayor
Ridin', winin', dinin' and shinin', know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't got time for fuckin' around, and horseplayin'
I'm makin' hits, my homies takin' hits, who's stayin'

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy's can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)

[Outro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Haha, haha
Yeah!
It's The Re-Up!
Haha
God, I love it
You know you hate that laugh, don't you?
Haha, haha
Keep doin' it
Do it again
What?
The laugh
Oh, haha, haha!
I like that
Haha, haha, haha, haha
Hehehe
You don't think they're gonna think we're really crazy, right?"

Listen To Your Heart

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that it's sorta unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryin' to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamamie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kitten-kaboodle
I'm just brutal. It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There’s a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 3: T.I]
I'm the man in my city ain't nobody wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stolen the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, shoulda seen me before I had children
Give dick to ya daddy's daughter and dare her to have children?
Hope he got some insurance 'cause death her is enduring?
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash on 'em, let him have it
Meanwhile, my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart"

The Apple

[Intro]
I'm a little nutty and I know it but if you go back and take a look at my history
You will see that I am not the only one who's off his rocker, there were many before me
I was always labeled the black sheep of the family, what a bad seed I'd grow to be
But if you take a look at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree

[Interlude]
Haha! Haha, haha, haha!
Alright look
I'mma tell you the story from my side
Maybe you'll understand, check it out

[Verse 1]
You done witnessed unexplainable shit
Too insane to explain, people run from what they just don't get
Maybe Shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit
Did I spit too soon? Should I have spoon fed 'em it?
But I was just so eager to prove I was even
Worth bein' in the same league or the room
Of the people of whom I was in
Every now and then, I look up like I was seekin' approval
Was it because of the pigment of my skin?
Or was it a figment of my imagination?
Maybe it bothered me more than it did them
Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then
But to me it was, see what it was
Was I had developed a complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse, now I'm next, let's see who balks
I'm in the booth staring back to see whose mugs
I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb
Was from Proof and the rest of the crew backed him up
And no one lied to each other 'cause none of us had deals
It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Verse 2]
Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg
'Cause she said that I had a baby sister
Who fell out of the window, I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects, I was like five/six
And how come, I remember Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogy
If it was the projects in Missouri?
'Cause those were my best friends until Isaac
Took my tricycle and my Uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
And ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut
With a switch and seventy-some stitches
Which is, to this day, why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture
Of a fictitious little sister who never existed
And this is why a part of my life's so twisted
But I can never be as sick as that bitch is
And by the way, that picture's one of my relatives

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Verse 3]
You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain
To see why everything I say is so insane
What's different about my brain
That separates me from other players in this game?
On the surface, it may seem like a scheme
Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy
But that's the last thing I need
Is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me
And I am not a G, never claimed to be
I gave my vest to Cashis, just hope he don't need it more than me
But we'll see, 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef
But if it comes our way, what do we turn the other cheek? Come on

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Outro]
Yeah, and I'm the crazy one right?
Whatever, then let me be the crazy one!

Cocaine

[Intro: Eminem & Jazmine Sullivan]
Yeah
Ooh...
This game is like cocaine
I want this more than anything in the world
Haha... So do I... At least I thought I did
Got to have it, yeah I need it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading

[Verse 1: Eminem]
This is a beat with no words at first, it’s a blank painting
Exercising the mind, it’s brain strength training
It starts off something like, ""Shady's an insane maniac
Yeah, Slim Shady, that's a zany name, ain't it?""
Now all you need's an image to go with the name, baby
Wifebeaters and white t-shirts, Hanes mainly
It's a long shot, but is it possible? There's a lane, maybe
If not he's gon' have to come and change the whole game, ain't he?
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it, he can see his name up in lights
Women screaming his fucking name, fainting
Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium
Joe Shmoe made it, he took his Plain Jane lady
And his baby Hailie out the trailer but he ain't trailing anymore
He's ahead of the race while maintaining his innocence
Little does he know his train is derailing
And he's about to be raped by this game anally, now

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that c-o-c-a-i-n-e?
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You’re operating on all cylinders, syllables spit like dillingers
Spilling your guts, people are feeling your mic skills
But these haters are ice grilling ya
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya but you can’t decipher
Why for the life of ya, it wasn’t like this when you were cyphering
Argue with your wife again, she found Vicodin
In your pants last night again, your dispute's public
Nothing is private anymore, oh, and your best friend?
Say bye-bye to him, what kind of apple you take a bite of, Slim?
(But this is what you wanted Marshall, ain't it?) Fuck no!
The way that it turned out was nothin' like the picture that I painted
In my head, sometimes a dream and making it's more fun
Than it's to actually make it, the game stripped me naked
It robbed me of ever having another real relationship
With another girl, this world is a fucking trip
As I slip in another world, proceed, take another hit
Sniff 'til I fucking hurl, tell 'em all to fucking sit
And spin 'til they fucking twirl, middle finger up again
Relapsing back in this game, oh well, fuck it then, now

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that c-o-c-a-i-n-e?
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)

[Bridge: Jazmine Sullivan]
You start off bright, just to see your name in lights
Just so you can live the life
You take a bite and lose your sight, they call this (fame)
You think you're good, just cause you got out the hood
Concerned only with getting dough, no longer poor
But lost your soul, they call it (fame)
I hear it callin', my name is callin'
Why you struggling when you could be ballin'?
My head is saying yes but my feet is stallin'
So many walkin' by the end they fallin'
But I got to have it, like Eve and the apple
She had to grab it, I got to take it, I got to make it
That's the plan and I can't forsake it, yee-yeah

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that c-o-c-a-i-n-e?
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)

Guess I can't leave it
So I'm ?
Oh well... (Fame, fame)

I Remember (Dedication to Whitey Ford/Everlast Diss)

[Intro]
Your mother.. you fuckin' faggot
Ayo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we ain't forget about you, you fuckin' homo, we still remember

[Verse 1]
There once was a man who liked to jump around
But he got too old to jump up and down
So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up
Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow
Left his boys in the House of Pain
It was the wisest decision he ever made
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
Was try to buck a .380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Verse 2]
I remember back when you had the Knack
And I remember when you had your first heart attack
I was right there laughin when I heard the news
I just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you
Maybe Ice-T's right, you are a bitch
You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing you could ever do
Was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Verse 3]
Remember back in '94, like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When House of Pain was outta fame like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again
Or even further back, when I first had heard ""The Knack""
And you were down with Syndicate, I went to get your shit, man I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound ridiculous, you dickless piece of shit
How could you diss me, bitch?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin, then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
Like you mad that someone else was white and tried to rhyme or somethin
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
But you're a homosexual, white rappin Irish (Muslim)
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a *Muslim* too
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you? I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin' sing
And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
So everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you
And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Outro]
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy fuck
And by the way, a .380's a fuckin' sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun, you little bitch
Next time say my fuckin' name in a song, don't be subliminal about it
You wanna fuckin' diss me, diss me you fuckin' faggot
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin' little bitch, fuckin' cunt"

Bad Influence

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!)

[Verse 1]
Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world, and shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill, scarier than a white journalist
In a room with Lauryn Hill human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot and people'll feel me
'Cause I'ma still be The Mad Rapper whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, making fun of your yacht
But I would like an award for the best rapper to get
One mic in The Source and a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back strikin' at Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissin' me off: even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit, I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)

[Verse 2]
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin' corners
Lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin' James Todd Senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death, as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge, and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now

[Chorus]
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)

[Verse 3]
My laser disc'll make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains are rippin' out your skull
So bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a role model, I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailie Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gilbert's paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scotts
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that ""Just the Two of Us"" would make you hate me this much
And ""Just the Two of Us,"" that ain't got shit to do with us
And our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)"

Ricky Ticky Toc

[Chorus: Eminem]
Once you call my name out, things will never be the same
They should've never let us get our foot in this game

[Verse: Eminem]
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice, I could lose it
At any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow just so that
I don't explode, and- have another episode
Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waiting for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas, my dick's so hard Anna
Nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it (Heheheh!)
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name
It's a game, 'cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Every day it's the same thing, people in this game
Try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us, everybody just wants
To have something to do with that
They all trying to get that stamp, they after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand ""How to Rob"" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common than we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Two years later, me and Doc had to come, and, uhh-
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye-to-eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
I'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was hollering ""Fuck Compton""
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when they were still making Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head, that seals the shit
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya' don't stop"

No One’s Iller

[Intro: Bizarre]
Yeah… ha ha ha (Bang!)
Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you
Eminem and Fuzz and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one's iller than me (What?)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doin' subpoenas
Hell nah, you ain't seen a crew, genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rappin' rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake
You can't stop it, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches: I'm painful to rappers
Then you can tell from these shells
How I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates – BLAAAOW!
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said, no one is iller than me, unnhh

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Me and Eminem and Mike, drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's nine to 10 I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
‘Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TV's and VCR's is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bombs at day care centers and yell: ""Everybody get out!""
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a two-piece
‘Cause she found out I was havin' an affair
With her 10-year-old niece

[Hook: Bizarre]
No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nobody better test me, ‘cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-Ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways — do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted, stab your abdomen
With a hand-crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to Hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van, wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked
By these fantastic furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grandmasters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

[Verse 4: Fuzz Scoota]
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds if I'm past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads, flashin' bread
Roll down the window: ""Bitch, you got some fantastic legs!""
You can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre, you get him and him
Swift, you get him and him, I'll get him and him
Leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin', ""Get the cops, quick!""
And got drop kicked, now she screamin', ""Stop it!""
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop, bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick
Sick of y'all niggas lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still don't know the top pick
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks, bitch
P Rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits
(No one) — Ain't nobody iller than me

[Hook: Bizzare]
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313

[Outro: Bizzare]
You have now witnessed four ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast"

Fly Away

[Chorus: Just Blaze]
Some people ask me where I been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted and try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe
I'll fly away (Fly away)
It ain't nuttin' in the way so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
And ain't nuttin' else to say so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon'
Die today (Die today)
'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
(Yeah, yeah) Yeah
And the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below
(Down below, yeah, yeah) Yeah
There's nuttin' else to say so I may as well
Fly away (Oh)
Yeah, there's nuttin' in my way so I may as well
Fly away
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away
Yeah

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Got my self-esteem back, got my confidence up
I'ma step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hangin' off of my butt
And you ain't 'bout to tell me nuttin', boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don't stink, I don't think so
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll
Are you ready now, here we go, the bald eagle has landed
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leavin' you stranded
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands, it's Play-Doh
I ain't back to play, though, they say he died in a fatal
Car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car
The white trash star, I fuck an RV-up like Brett Favre
Homie, you got it backwards, you're dipping your soup inside your crackers
I can carry rap till my back hurts
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractors
Get my back right then I'm right back on you bastards
I was chasing the dragon, I don't know what happened
It's like the feeling I had when I first started rappin', I just
Couldn't seem to get back and recapture that magic, so I went back
To the lab, that's where I been at, when

[Chorus (Condensed): Just Blaze]
Some people ask me where I been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted and try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe
I'll fly away (Fly away)
It ain't nuttin' in the way so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
And ain't nuttin' else to say so I may as well
Fly away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I took a hiatus, haters, now I'm back to cause trouble
Got the fuckin' shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles, I'm the
*Explosion*, you ain't fucking sick, the hospital
Won't even give you cough drops for coughs, cocksucker
You think you hot? You ain't even lukewarm My puke's hotter than you
You're soft, I use fire to cool me off
I told 'em I'd grow up one day and show 'em I'd be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightning bolts and throw 'em
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgi-porgi kissed the girls, make the girls cry for it
Make 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn
Swoon over my sweat towels, it's mind blowin'
Yes, I'm livin' the dream, homie, can't nothing compare
I’m so up, I’m stuck in midair, I’m lovin' it, yeah
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters are so pussy, they afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe 'em back pay
They spat in my face, now I'm back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste
And slap it back out before I step back outta this crap, they
Slap me, now I'm slappin' 'em back, hey
Fuck it, we're slap happy, yeah, okay, now I'm talking some smack, ayy
And I ain't looking back, in fact, they can stare at my ass crack
How's that for hind sight? What the track say?

[Chorus: Just Blaze]
Some people ask me where I been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted and try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe

1997 Rap Olympics

[RAP BATTLE 1]
I'ma tell you this for your own benefit
Your shit was dope as hell, 'specially when you wrote ninety-percent of it
What you need to do is practice on your freestyles
'Fore you come up missin', like Snoop Dogg's police files
This type of literature that I'm spittin' be hittin'
You gonna swear to God this shit was written
But it wasn't, I'll kill a dozen rappers when I'm buzzin'
Guzzlin', beat your ass like a jealous husband
Now, you boys are about to suffer and see north
When you go in a coma longer than Vladimir Konstantinov
Cut the damn machine off
Get a clean cloth, and wipe this bloody video screen off

[RAP BATTLE 2]
I'm movin' in for the kill, plus I got the trap set
I can tell you're wack as fuck, and I ain't even hear you rap yet
Look at you thinkin', ""I'm about to whip his ass
‘Cause I'ma do some written shit, plus I get to go last.""
Well, guess what? Even if I go first, it's no worse
My shit's still gon' demolish yo' verse
I'm 'bout to slice you like a Ginsu
And anything you say can and will be used against you
In a court of law, I'm short and raw
Take your fuckin' shit and cut it off
Yo, you wanna be a dope emcee?
Look, don't get mad and start takin' your period out on me

[RAP BATTLE 3]
You wanna represent on the microphone, but you rap sleazily
I ain't about to battle this fake ass Eazy-E
There ain't no way I'ma do this bullshit
I don't give a fuck, I'm loaded up with a full clip
Time of the month? You couldn't get the tape of the day
Take him away, I rip him like a paper mache
I heard you rap before, you ain't about shit
This whole battle was mismatched, like your outfit
Try to battle me and get your mouth split
You sold out, like Ticketmaster Outlet
Ha ha, I bust and I crush
I don't give a fuck, ain't no way that you can fuck with us
I'm givin' back with pimp shit
I laminate that ass in a badge and wear it at the Rap Olympics

[RAP BATTLE 4]
Blah-badee-blah-da-blah-blah—stop babblin'!
You so fuckin' wack I'ma walk away while you battlin'
Fuck that, I'm on a brand new solo mission
To make sure that Wendy Day kicks your ass out of the rap coalition
I throw a switch at an execution
With an overdose of devotion
Don't talk back, I'm the dope, bitch
So who you sound like on the mic?
There was only one 2Pac, your thug style is just one big sike
Take a big hike, bitch, you can't catch me
Your best rhymes still ain't shit, like a patsy
What the fuck you gonna do?
I'll battle anybody in your crew
And I don't give a fuck, I slaughter boys
Especially wack-ass emcees that will wear a fake-ass corduroy

[RAP BATTLE 5]
I'm 'bout to make this mic short circuit
This beat is wack as fuck—this shit fits you perfect!
I got so many ways to diss you that I'm playful with you
I'll let a razor slit you, 'til they have to staple-stitch you
And everybody in this fuckin' place'll miss you
If you try to turn my facial tissue to a racial issue
Nobody's hearin' you, you're a wack liar
Damn! All your white jokes just backfired
‘Cause, bitch, you barkin' up the wrong tree
Now go tell all your boys that you was beat by a honkey
I don't give a fuck, I'll kill ya
Bitch, you better recognize me, like I look familiar
Anything you say, I'ma kill ya
Grill ya, when I fuckin' drill ya
I'm Marsh, but you're the one that's mellow"

Backstabber

[Intro: Police Scanner]
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back, fellas
He could be coming at your girlfriend next

[Verse 1]
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword, don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 2]
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Lockin' down every block and put up metal detectors
Protect yours and be sure that you stand close
Watch each other's backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 3]
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and to beat him unmercifully
For what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last
Followin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass
To drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail
I heard a yell, the voice sounded familiar
""Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya!""

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 4]
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezin' at dust, and swingin' at the spider webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint, in my mouth
Then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 5]
Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

[Police Voice]
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home
I repeat, he's going back to the crazy home
Job well done

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!"

Hell Breaks Loose

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want the fans jumping
I want the fists pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups?
Shady's come to feel ya up, are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard
What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
(Chkk-chk-chk) What's my name?
Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them
'Cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit's getting embarrassin'
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-dididi-dadada-didi
He makes it look so easy, girl, you just hit the lottery

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
This is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters
Your homie rolled in with Mathers
Now chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, this song’s like a seance, it haunts
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off of what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose
Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
A mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to retract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth
Girl, your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch
And this is when all hell breaks loose

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know you're feeling discouraged, but, homie, just mark my words
I'm murderin' the flow, liquid courage, I'm finna blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit' your ho
With speakers knocking, it's three-o'clock, me and Doc then proceed to drop
E and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there?
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT, yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hatin' on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat
Dre fall off? That's news to me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose"

Microphone Freestyle

[Verse 1]
Once again, it's the sinister cynical minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administerer of the pain, he just finished huffin' the paint
And muffler fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he sprays, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares, making the hairs
All on the back of ya neck stand like Dracula, yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yeah, Angela, so I command ya to start dancin'
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansson
Enter my gas chamber, you gangsta? My ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table

[Verse 2]
I'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing
Windows opening, shutting; doors opening, closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only 'sposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink hosing
Myself, self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think; this will make everything rosy
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in
I'm yodelling ""Rosie, won't you come out to play?""
And no sense wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines
In the papers, making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put Nurofens in my syrup and stirred 'em
You never heard 'em like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events  that he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels
And still can spin, straw to gold like Rumplestilskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills
The Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin'
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch
Mildred, he's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, MC's will get fricassed on the grill, then"

Monkey See, Monkey Do

[Intro]
Ayo 50
What I tell you?
We ain't even have to say shit, they did it, ha ha

[Chorus]
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, game's over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

[Verse]
Doesn't take much for me to raise such a stink up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You ain't even gotta say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
Is like smearing a bloodstain with a paint brush
I can’t explain what it is my brain does
But however it works, it's insane, it's plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain that’s dangerous
It’s a whole combination of things, it takes nuts
And I’m not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
I'm patiently waiting for the day, I’m anxious
To see the look on ya fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
Ya drunk, you ain't tough
Whatever you drank must've just turned you into some gangstas
This is me talking, motherfucker, this ain’t drugs
You wanna pop shit? Wake up then make up
Fuck that! It’s too late chump, now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the caliber that Nas and Jay does
Opens up his jaw to say somethin' or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fucking dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
'Til I pull the paint off, I never been shot
But I think me and Fifty must've been cut from the same cloth
'Cause I've always came off like Ja's chain when they try to rush him
And lost and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don’t stop, only thing that I wait for
Is the day that I ain't gotta report to probate court
'Cause I'ma give you all a reason to hate more
'Cause I been holding my tongue 'til I got a sprained jaw
A lot of rappers on my list that just ain’t Ja
And I'ma read that motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft 'cause 8 Mile
When I come back I’ll be shooting more than just paintballs
Trust me

[Chorus]
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, game's over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

[Outro]
Fucking dummies
This ain’t chess
You playin' motherfucking checkers
This shit is all day, man, it’s too easy
We playing chess, you playing checkers
You 'bout to get your mother fucking asses jumped
Fucking punks
And by the way
We ain’t just talking to one person
We talking to every-motherfucking-body who wants to bring it
'Cause we bring it into anybody who wants to bring it
So bring it
Don’t pick up the ball if you don’t wanna play, man
It’s all fucked up now
Fuck I’m supposed to do now?
Huh?!
What the fuck I'm supposed to do?!
Yo, we out!"

[Intro]
It's like this and like that and like this
It's like this and like that and like this

[Verse 1]
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd, Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mind-state
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

[Verse 2]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin' an acappella that'll chop a fella
To Mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feeding you liquid darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream ""I'm still alive!""
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crowbar to pry her apart with
Motherfucker
Slim Shady, bitch

[Verse 3]
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers? We blowing up your house killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
Motherfucker"

Paint be flyin' off my car be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids
I got that whole block lookin' like it's Candyland
Ask about me, man, they be like, ""There go the candy man""
I park the car in the garage and go in and
Come back the next mornin', the rims are still spinnin'
Hit the doors on that Phantom, man, that shit looks like the Batmobile
32 inch rims, shit, I ain't even got no wheels
Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat? Custom mustard stain
Now let's go hit the mall, y'all know that we finna ball
Get out the car, they be like, ""Ah, there go them superstars!""
Hit every single store, flash a fuckin' wad of cash

When I be at a theater, shit, anything goes
I'm ballin' outta control, girls know I'm loaded with dough
But shit, I'm stingy as fuck, I'm fuckin' stingy as hoes
These bitches don't get a crumb, and it come but I'm like, ""What up?""

Bitch, get the fuck out my car if we ain't finna fuck

You fuckin' keyed up my Benz? Bitch, I beat up my friends
Don't think I won't beat a bitch, I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs
You fuckin' retard, I'll have you suckin' farts out my seat
I'll teach you not to know how to control your bowels when you eat
What the fuck do you think that colostomy bag is for, looks?
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks
I fuckin' take a Make-A-Wish Foundation patient with me
How 'bout some coke inside of your saline solution IV
Turn around and use it on me, you tryna snort all my keys
You fuckin' brat, get in back, you're comin' to Florida with me
Tell your momma I'ma drop you off at the hospital later
We finna make this run, take this gun and cover me, Slater and quit your—

""Tracy, I joined this class 'cause I thought I’d be cooking with a partner
But she’s never here, and I don’t get twice the credit for all the work.""

""I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.""

""I know, but I’m over here in my unit, every day, cooking my terrible-tasting food, and then I gotta look over at Evan. I mean, look at him, it looks like the most fun I’ve ever seen in my entire life. And, I’m just saying, I wash and dry, I’m like a single mother. And no offense but, everyone takes this class to get an A and it’s bullshit, but uh, no offense, I’m just saying. And I’m not putting down your profession, but when am I gonna need to cook tiramisu? Am I gonna be a chef? No. There’s 3 weeks left in school, give me a freaking break, sorry for cursing. OH MY GOD, that’s like the coolest fucking story I’ve ever heard in my life! It’s insane.

8 Mile: Sweet Home Alabama Freestyle

[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
Well, Jimmy moved in with his mother
'Cause he ain't got no place to go

[Rabbit (Eminem)]
And now I'm right back in the gutter
With a garbage bag that's full of clothes

[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
Buss it, buss it, 'cause
You live at home in a trailer
What the hell you gonna do?

[Chorus: Rabbit (Eminem)]
'Cause I live at home in a trailer
Mom, I'm comin' home to you

Well, my name is Jimmy, his name's Greg Buehl
Me, him and you we went to the same school
This ain't cool, I'm in a rage
He's tappin' my mom we're almost the same age
On the microphone I drop bombs
Look at this car, thanks a lot, mom (ha ha)
Here, happy birthday, Rabbit
Here's a brand new car, you can have it
A 1928 Delta
This shit won't even get me to The Shelter
And I can't even say I'm from Motown
'Cause I'm back in the 810 now

Till Hell Freezes Over

[Intro]
Yo yo yo yo yo (this is)
This is my motherfuckin' anthem (hip-hop)
To hip-hop music (anthem)
'Cause I'ma keep doin' hip-hop music
Until the day that I die (Until the motherfuckin' day that I die)
Aight, bitch?

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and Ouija boards
Lightin' candles campin' out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holdin' a rifle, with a life full of drama like 2Pac's
Jumpin' off rooftops drunk after I do shots
Landin' in someone's backyard gettin' chewed up by two rots
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash comin' out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizzas, now I got twelve visas
So tell Jesus that I'ma quit sinnin' when hell freezes

[Hook]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
Bitch, till hell freezes over
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes (over)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I used to be too heavy in that cruising Gratiot crap
I think I fucked my head up listenin' to acid rap
I go to parties bumpin' Nasty Nas's new song
And smoke pot 'til I get high and stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced, ain't it? It tastes tainted
The whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like Sci-Fi TV, ""Fuck ICP, buy my CD!"" (Yeah)
That's what I'm screamin' while I'm handin' out promo tapes of my debut
Tellin' bitches, ""Let me eat your pussy while I shave you!""
Ain't no shame in my game, I turn the party out
Makin' everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

[Hook]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
Bitch, till hell freezes over
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over

For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (here)
Two dudes ran up and jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast, it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming ""GET HIM!""
I grabbed one,  lit him on fire, pinned, and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept dropin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' the middle of the kitchen

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
We should do something like that, yeah (Yeah!)

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck! (Haha)
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up! (Woo!)
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, b-boom—Shady!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again it's the... illest and realest killers
The most villainous, Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners? This music is in us, and it's
Not over till we say it's finished
And G-Unit spinners will keep spinning
This is hip-hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep sticking them pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next?
He's already reconciled with his {ex}
A chainsaw and an axe
Choke a bitch to death, strangle her neck
While we have sex, while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the facts, yeah, bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect? I never left, baby, I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zie automatically
Says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off-track (*Bl-la-la*)
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it, I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack-ass rap, kiss my black ass!

[Break: Eminem]
(Fuck this!)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Nah, Em, tell them to kiss my Black ass, the clean parts, the shitty parts
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the fif'll tear your ass apart
I came in this game crushing motherfuckers from the start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich, bitch
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick (Uh-huh)
Teflon wrapped on, 'case I get clapped on (Oh!)
D's searching the whip, glad I left the MAC home
Still grinding, still shining, nigga, Lord knows
You rocking with the kid to spit sicker sick flows (Woo!)
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it (Haha)
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
Every day Dre day, front and cause a melee
Turn the town upside-down with a frown upside-down
I smile through something fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm fucking with straight stacks, I'm kicking you straight facts
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back! (Now...)

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!

Oh no!
What's happening to my brain?
I can't believe this is happening
Again!

[Verse 1]
Lava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
I think I'm out of gas, man, I need another mask
I'd ask my mother, but I think she's laughing at the plants
A half a gram of graham crackers and some Van de Kamp's
I think I'll eat some Ambiens like they're candied yams
Cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack
Abra-fucking-cadabra, motherfucker, look who's back
Just like a pendulum, Satan's pentagram swings
I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing
Shit, I think I might have did it when I was dancing
While I was chopping one of my legs off when I pulled a hamstring
First I Re-Up, then I Relapse
Go to rehab then I Detox after I see Doc
And I'll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle
'Cause I react like the She-Hulk when I see NyQuil

Into the well, baby Jessica fell, she may have wetted herself
Quit playing, get her some help

Every day in journals, saying how she wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo
I'm the medicine man, my medical marijuana
Was prescribed by a doctor, shove a typewriter up Per-
-ez Hilton's ass, shit, almost forgot that
He's always shoving something up his ass, so why not that?
And fuck it, while I'm venting, let's shove a vending machine
Up his rear end when he's bending over, pretending that he
Didn't say anything that would be offending to me
Stick his head in a blender, begin blending in G
Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?
Put him under the stairs? People are already under there
Hmm, I wonder where... wait, I think the cubpoard's bare
Stuff him up in the Tupperware and shove him up in there

Vicodin's like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again
I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again
Who'm I kidding? I couldn't quit this shit if my life depends
I relapsed twice after I came outta Brighton then
Yeah, rehab's nice, I had my name up in lights again
You see that's why I can't decipher what life I'm in
I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her then dice her then
It sounds so enticing, isn't it nice when I'm hype again?
On nights when I'm like this, no time to write this, just type it in
If I could get my pen to slow down, what'd I write just then?
Man, I'm 'bout to hyperventilate, I just have hypertension
I have the type of mental state you couldn't comprehend
Unusually stupid of you for you to think I'm your friend
I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence
I offer no mercy, the controversy is once again

[Hook]
Oh no! (Oh no!)
Here we go again (again)
Don't know (Don't know)
When it's going to end (When will it- stop?)
Uh oh! (Uh oh!)
Where did it begin? (When did it begin?)
So long ago (So long ago)
Maybe way back when (Maybe way back when) (Relapse!)

Oh no! (Oh no!)"

I’m Having a Relapse

[Intro]
Torture chambers, secret passageways, vats of acid, and deadly vaults

[Intro]
Ohh!
Chk-it, chk-it chk-it chk-it
Ohh!
Gue—chk-it chk-it—Guess who's back? Frrk-it
I said, ohh
Gue—Gue—Gue—Gue—it-chk-it
I said, ohh!
Rrrrr-chk-it-chk-it—Guess who's back? Frrk-it
I said, man!
Chk-it-chk-it-chk-it-chk-it
Damn! Ohh!
Gue—Gue—Guess who's back?
Gue—Gue—Gue—Gue—Guess who's back? Frrk-it
Damn, it feels good to be back
Guess who's back?
I'm having a relapse

[Verse: Eminem]
How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem?
Well, to be honest
The smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They've compelled me to kill this elderly man
And I get these panic attacks, pop a Xanax, relax
Trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass
Then I get manic-depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed
Man, it's kick-ass, the first thing I put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of pace
And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you face
And slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
That's bacon souffle you making, ain't you? Well, thank you, Jason
There goes one more coma due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more Soma and I'll be done for, mama
Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium, lost it
Shoving the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet
It seems like every day, I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that eighteen-month-old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breaking his neck in eighty-some places, baby, here Shady comes, lady
He's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chainsa-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dum-dums
Yeah, here I come-come, you hear the rumbling? Vrumm-vrumm
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum-drum
A head and torso of someone; where'd it come from?
Who's it belong to? Maybe the girl with the long, blonde hair
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly, there's somethin' wrong, 'cause she didn't come home
She's missing, where is she? Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now, everybody get your dance on to my damn song, come on!"

Public Enemy #1

[Intro]
Hello, what up? Hello?
Yo, I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you right back

[Verse]
I sense someone's tappin' into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?
The FBI might be tryin' to pull my file soon
I might be walkin' blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seein' rockets light up the night sky
Right outside the window of my living room
And if they do, you can say good night
And bye-bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth a walking-dead man
Blank stare, dead pan, look on my face
As I gaze into space, as I wait to be scooped up in that van
As I mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gonna say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere
And I'll go down in the history as the bloodsuckin' leech
Who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dyin' the villain, not the hero, splendid
Stupendous way to end this
I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flashback to September 7th
When 2Pac was murdered in Vegas
He said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it
Should we ever live to regret it
Like the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By the crazed lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block
In the library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know, or do they?
Who's they for them to say ""touché""?
We're all vulnerable and it's spook-ay
This is about as kook-ay as I've ever felt now
Count down to nuclear meltdown
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
You can run, you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nothin'
When it's time, it's your time, you are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy number one"

Bump Heads (Ja Rule Diss)

[Intro: 50 Cent, Eminem, Green Lantern]
Yeah
Shady (Ha-ha)
50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-Unit (Ha-ha)
Here we go again
Yeah
The evil genius, Green Lantern

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire 'cause Shady said so
I'm on fire

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't tryin' to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say, ""What up?"", keep steppin', and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin' reckless, but if you go check my belt
You may see something else I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja must have lost his mind
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael?
Just keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie dance to your songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I'll hurt your pride, dawg, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after
Syllable I just slap you, killin' you faster
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs
Of that shit you on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta (Green Lantern!)
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to
So what's the deal, where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, ""Ja, what up, dawg?""
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there with all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'm a grown man, dawg, come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be
Come on!

[Chorus: 50 Cent and Tony Yayo]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
Tony!

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja, you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol
I clap at your ass with this chrome .38
And put six thru your hats, a seven and 3/8's
Irv, you ain't Suge Knight, you shook night
I'll put my knife in your wind pipe and breeze through the turnpike
You know and I know who took your chain
You got robbed two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit, all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with Steven Segal, bitch

[Chorus: 50 Cent and Tony Yayo]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
Lloyd Banks!

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Fuck that, I'm miles away
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out your man
We killin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised blowin' chocolate up out your van and (Break it, break it, break it down!)
They see me pop a boy icy 'cause I could
You been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood (Hood)
'Cause when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
How you want it with us if half of your artists got make-up on?
Every magazine I open you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' 'bout what pain is, sucka
I'll put your ass underground like a train conductor, muh'fucker

[Chorus: 50 Cent and Tony Yayo]
I know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me (Wanna bump heads with me)
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me (Wanna bump heads with me)

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
Yeah, nigga
Yeah, Shady Aftermath

Fuck you think they call us G-Unit for?

I got a riddle: what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian? No!
His name's Raymond and, oh, so sorry, yo, Osorio
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
Rappin' in Joe Blows basement, I apologized for it befo', so
Either accept it or you don't and let's move on
If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin' each other's butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

[Lloyd Banks & Eminem]
Hold on, hold on, hold p
New York city man
It's the kid Lloyd Banks
And if you hearin' what I'm hearin' right now
You know this ain't no regular shit homie
This somethin' special, and we gotta bring this back
Green, come on
Countdown to **Armaggedon! Let's go!**

[Hook: Eminem]
I got a riddle what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle

It's Dave Raymond and oh, so sorry yo, Osorio

Keep walkin' around sniffin' each other's butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

[Verse 1: Eminem]
The question I ask is: how can I explain this?
How can I swing this in English language
If I switch to slang and turn man to mayn
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain?
Am I being real or am I being fake?
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine?
Or am I caught up in this hot water? Wody on my daughter
I told ya I love this culture, don't let em' insult ya
I'ma tell ya one more time, this is the environment that I was brought up in
But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration
Or should I say shun?
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism, huh?
Your face is numb, you're stunned, your look is cold
Like that of a man of seventy-some-years-old
And it only gets colder, which Is why I understand
And can't be mad at a forty-four-year-old fan
With a chip on his shoulder, who only owns a half of a magazine
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
Papa can't stand me, papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back, and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell ""Apartheid"" loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But ain't nobody over here buyin' two white guys disguised as pro-black
There is no slack
Far heart for college grad in a fitted hat and a hunch back
Standin' by the clearance coat rack
In some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs
Yeah

[Outro: Eminem]
Shady in the place to be seen
And I got what it takes to rock the mic, aight!
Still not gonna cater these punks
Fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips haters dicks cunts!"

I'm reminiscin' on your tenderness
And the snugglin' and teasin'
Missin' what I remember
Kissin' and huggin' and squeezin'
Buggin' and wheezin'
I'm havin' trouble when breathin'
It's even tougher when sleepin'
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm sufferin' and grievin'
For lovin' and leavin'
You're all I'm thinkin' of in the evenin'
You got my knees bucklin' and weakenin'
Thoughts of nothin' but freakin'
That I'm strugglin' to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speakin'
I got some game that I'm preparin' to run
The way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun
No matter what you're wearin' you stun
'Cause you're comparin' to none
I want to share in the fun, I feel a passionate lust
When I imagine it just alone at last when it's us
I see you graspin' to trust
But my intentions are good, let's leave the past in the dust
I'm not askin' to rush
And answer me immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me
""I love you"" (I love you, baby)
'Cause I just need you to see
How much I'm eager to be your man legally wed
Your love's keepin' me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down
'Cause ain't nobody like you nowhere to be found

[Hook: Angela Workman]
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby

But you're the one I want in my life baby

I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby

[Verse 2: Eye-Kyu]
Baby, it's all on you, it's you I call on, boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus
You can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sexes
We'll start it off with caviar, Dom Pérignon
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see, nobody will hurry things
I got the Izze, the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thang that day
It's still all right 'cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
You're an incredible one that's rare
I bet in edible underwear
You'll look impeccable, none compare
I dream of freakin' you, the women that I'm speakin' to
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do
So, now we all set to play, only thing left to say
Is when you step away, baby, look over in the négligée

I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby

But you're the one I want in my life baby

Now I got the cops on my tail for that
Run up on your car with a stale banana
In your tail pipe, can't believe you fell for that
It could've been a molotov cocktail for that
Wait a minute, man, what the hell was that?
I heard a noise, where you going? What are you, bananas?
You can't go back there, stupid ass

Of whipped cream, what the hell you gonna do with that?

Have a little quick look, go on, sick prick
She's probably six foot tall like Big Foot
The hell with that, we probably should run
Don't dare look back, we probably, probably
Probably there probably was a problem
At the post office or something
But you probably didn't know that, did you?
Now, what you gonna do when she gets you?
I ain't going with you, forget you
Quit tryna hold my hand, mister
Pretend she's your little sister, little sister

No, Zack, don't go back in there
It's too late now, she's grabbin' hair
He screams, bloody Mary, grabs a mirror
But 'stop' just ain't in her vocabulary
Get off me, please, get off me, stop
Balling back at a coffee shop
They go non-stop, she says go
He says no, she says oh
Back and forth, they scream and shout
Yeah, boy, let them demons out
It's the kind of nightmare you dream about

Chillin', cold as hell
Yes, it is. Hey, bus didn't come here, didn't he?
No. Hey look, you got 15 cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store. Alright, man?
Quick, ‘cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look
You should just, how much you got there?
I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar, know what I mean?
Just throw it in there, they ain't gonna know. You know what? Ayy look, I'm sick of takin' this damn bus everywhere, man
You gotta make some moves or somethin'
I know, look, I'm tryna get rich
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car. You know what I'm sayin'?
I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Yeah, look, hey, we gotta make some hit records or somethin', you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause I'm tired of bein' broke

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of havin' a turn to earn money to burn
Mappin' out my strategies to get rich, huh
My desire's like a scratch that needs to get itched, huh
'Cause, man, I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothin' is different to me, so what else is there to see?
I'll be the prisoner to flee from all of this misery
I'm not wishin' to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me for this and agree
You're missin' the key, you ain't even in the vicinity
Unconditionally, my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you, the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a missionless course
When your shit is in the stores, 'cause you can be a star

[Hook: Eminem]
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yo, I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handlin' business
I'm cancelin' Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just
Choose the few that I trust
Them's the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta Philpot, get your grill shot
The 5 Ela for life: my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through in the nine
My crew's true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or bein' wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man plannin' what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star

No matter wherever you are

""Look in the mirror! You're nothing! You're nothing without me! Look in the motherfucking mirror!""
""Leave me alone!!! Leave me the fuck alone!!!""

Weed Lacer

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, weed lacer, 97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I’m on some loced shit, some fed up with the bein’ broke shit
I’m not to joke with, bitch I don’t sell crack, I smoke it
Havin' a coke fit, goin' through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailie
My brain’s dusted, I’m disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets, empty medicine cabinets
Losin' battles to wack rappers cause I’m always too blunted
Walkin’ up in the cypher smokin’, talkin’ about “Who want it?”
Thug and a crook; every drug in the book I’ve done it
My 9’s at your brain, is that you chain? run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavor
Aggressive nature got me stickin’ you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer
Stole your momma’s Acura, wrecked it, and sold it back to her
Boostin’ Nike jackets, escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me, I might be back, trick
So barricade your entrance, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses
Chasin’ dips, take ‘em on long vacation trips
Kidnappin’ ‘em and trappin’ ‘em in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips, slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Gut you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama, don’t you cry, your son is too far gone
I’m so high, I don’t even know what label I’m on
I’m messed up, I feel just like an overworked plumber
I’m sick of the crap, what’s Jack Kevorkian’s phone number?"

Em360 Rapcity Backroom Freestyle

[Intro: Big Trigger]
Yea Ya'll know what it is
Rap City presents Em360
Slaughterhouse, Eminem, Big Tigg, Just Blaze!
On the 1s and 2s, oh-oh

[Intro: Eminem]
Yo Tigg, get in the not booth
And spit the truth, to the young youth

[Verse 1: Big Trigger]
Aight, ay, Amex don't leave home without your cards
But this Hip Hop, so don't leave home without your bars
And for some of these rap stars, that's just too bad
Cause you can't bring out them bars, that you ain't never had
It's Eminem and Slaughterhouse, yeah you know we the truth
And ohh the game is out of order, since we closed the booth
Yes indeed original, beats the replacement cause
The back room will never be what the basement was

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
I'm the realest mo'fucker that I know
Wasn't always the case guess the figure had to grow
I do it for the love I don't do it for the dough
But I know these sucker figures will so they keep me on my toes
What's sad is I couldn't tell you what I'm hated for
And them painkillers didn't murder the pain they gave me more
These fans on my head now they say they want the old Joe
I grew up mature y'all can't see that this the old Joe
Want to see me lose every battle of depression
No matter what it do to me, no matter my regression
They want to see me fall, want to ruin my regiment from the start
Want to cut the beat off soon as I let em in my heart
I'd be the first to admit it, lost focus for a while
Sendin' unsolicited dick pics to dimwitted thick chicks
Was so high I lost track of my ways
Then I fell in love with a baby and got mad at her age
The way she act and behave, was it an act or a phase
How you trife when I gave you life
You was lacking in wage
You don't want say hi or speak to me
Bet you makin 200 dollars by weekly
Try to help the world out, bring some reparation
And forget being humble in a state of desperation
Ain't gotta ask what to help with no hesitation
And for me to deal with it I might need some meditation
I love you but its best we stay apart, segregation
And to cope with the feeling I might need some medication
Trust me I don't never want to see that side of Joe
It would kill us all slow, one reason I'm the realest mother-mother I know

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9]
Its Nickle, riding round in that Maserati four seat
Symbol on the grill looking like Tony Stark's goatee
Best rapper alive and you know me
The most distinguished shooter that's coming up out of the D since Joe D
I take mines at lead point
At the risk of having to shave my garlic clove in a razor inside a fed joint
Hip hop is alive, but the rhymes died
Only fear I have is ""world star"" being yelled from my blind side
Don't get me wrong it ain't like I ain't never lost a fight
But these days I'm more like a lyrical artiste
I'm outlining everybody in chalk white
The off-beat deceased version of Dr. Narcisse
This ain't blueprint, your idolizing
You tryna jump fast that's foolish of you in my drunk past and handing me my pilot's license
That's plain stupid, your boy's a star
Sitting in that drop top fish bowl and the doors ajar
It's ironic I remember when I couldn't afford a car
And now it's back and forth
The black one or white one I call 'em Macklemore
And Lord Jamar, first we defyin' the odds
We not a group, we more like a circular firing squad
This not a booth, this is our house and we won't stop
We killed the cypher two times already
What you gon' give us an award
But we won't stop for shutting down the internet
Now tell ya momma hi, and tell Rihanna we ain't finished yet

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
When we step in that booth, that's when the flame enters
Best spit, make any set trip, yeah its the gang members
Waving that shady flag, navy jag
Matching the yank' fit, with the polo brief showing, due to the lazy sag
I'm in a crazy kind of place
I got this thing right on my waist that'll leave tears on your baby mommas face
So chill, I'm in a crazy kind of place, I got this thing below my waist
That'll leave kids on your baby mommas face, for real
The flow gets cracked, as it came in capsules
Your cap just started snapping
My starter caps was snapping
When cross color was cracking
And my cane was half full
With the half moon park, hope you rap dudes smart
Don't piss me off like the bathroom mop
You don't want it with me
If I'm throwing hooks at you, that don't mean the chorus for free
So save your jabs its way better
If I start throwing jabs I'm talking Zabs first three round against Mayweather
Yeah I'm a crook from the brook, that mastered how niggas shook turned notebook
Broke cook, I'm so dope look
Bring the beat back with no hook just bars
Just a thing of ours that make their pants drop, make em open up their bras
Move g-strings like guitars, that's nothing, that's something light
Like Riesling at the bar
Y-A-O-W-A, if y'all ain't saying Yaowa by now you got nothing to say
This like NWO vs NWA, y'all like the rockers versus the ROC
Full of nothing but Jays
Check the rocks its nothing fugaz'
But don't get stupid my Cooper clique will throw shots for a couple of days
Make it horny when we out, Amityville horror, y'all don't want it with the house

[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Slaughter season, y'all the reason
Real dudes I'm bringing some more in
Like a Polynesian
Sick with the llama squeezing
Bullets flew and the chopper sneezing
Got your body and legs torn, but before you was airborne
You was bob and weaving still getting hit till your nos' is weezing
They set you deep in your coffin sleeping
I'm gone off the deep end, I'm a wolf, this industry my sheep skin
I'm out here hunting with my ink pen
I'm living like a kingpin
Doing it for my g's in the pen
Dreaming about two-piecing a police chief's chin
You rappers something candy coated, I don't like suckers
I'm Iron Mike, I don't like Busters
You looking for em' fly dudes like Orville and Wilbur
You got the Wright brothers
No bright jeans, no bright colors
I'm the second coming, the one that Pac predicted
Islamic, Gnostic and Christian, the flow so godly you got to listen
I backed you in a dodge a minute
Like MC Eiht in a L.A. hat, these rappers straight tryna dodge a menace
I'm looking at your videos, look like your watching tennis
Brothers dressed like Maria Sharapova wearing yoga pants
Meanwhile Big Poppa was rocking linens
I guess that era's over man, hold on
I'm splitting atoms when the scientific spitting is getting at em'
I give em' different patterns, they didn't fathom, they stealing my styles
Before me you didn't have em'
You rappers made in my image like when God was inventing Adam
Stab em in the abdomen when its crunch time
I truly flip like Mayweather pissed of at a movie script
Too many punchlines
Family I'm amongst mine
I keep the peace like a monks mind
.357 fade your favorite barber
Leave you in an old bush like an unshaven Barbara
Don't stop what we doing
When you see L.A. your team will be ruined
This game need a new villain, I'm the kind to murder you on vine, ooh kill em'

[Introduction: Big Trigger]
Ladies and gentlemen
Now introducing the man, the myth, the legend
Mister Marshall Mathers AKA (chicka-chicka) Slim Shady

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Ayo, can we cut this beat off?
I might need to do this acapella, yo
Role model?
I'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles of Coke products
If she don't swallow, and tie her to the bumper, hit the throttle
While I'm tryna hit the potholes, I'll freaking take Madonna to McDonalds
Any ho'll end up horizontal gettin' fondled, I don't cuddle, I don't coddle
Only motto that I follow's everything I drive, whether it's a Navajo or a Tahoe
It's got a ho in it
Nah, ho, I don't got no freaking bronco
You looking for a buck, get a horse, fuck Tonto
I got a rusty Hondo with some bondo
And a box of condoms, little blond ho
Fuck me? Fuck you too, like I'm at Bonnaroo booing Bono
And I ain't from this planet so nanu, nana, nanu
I'm intolerable, too volatile, screw it
I don't gotta make the honor roll to be on a roll
I don't know much, what I do know I do it pronto though
So knock it off, all these knock-off-me's,
The last thing the world needs is another me
But if you think this is part two to Recovery
Or ""Love the Way You Lie"" part twelve
Or something heart felt, you 'bout to make a discovery
Like you found Christopher Columbus' compass
Ain't dumbing shit down for you dumb motherfuckers, so suck it
I took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach
That punctured a lung, punk, and I'm still functioning from it
Chump
It was nothing
Now watch while I fuckin' one up it and toot my own horn
Once I think of something to trump it
And I don't need a fucking instrument to sound off
Like the trunk of an elephant; the triumphant
Return of the ether spitting retard, reborn
But chances of you having another re-birth, slim to none
Like a skinny Mother Teresa, give a fuck if it's Easter, so kiss my keister
'Cause that's the only thing I'll turn the other cheek for"

Jealousy Woes II

[Intro: Sample]
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!

[Woman's voice: (Talking over the singing)]
Jealous?! What he mean ""jealous""?
Know what I'm sayin'? He just mad ‘cause he all with them ugly hoes, know what I'm sayin'?
Girls don't buy him no clothes
He bought that ho some clothes!
He don't buy me no clothes
That nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, what do I got to be jealous fo'?
He ain't gonna make it nowhere
He ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean…

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I come home every single day from workin' double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me
When you kiss me, then you diss me
And we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers, tryin' to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only squabble over irrelevant issues
Too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings, you say I'm bad at timin' things
So what's a man to do
When all I hand to you is handed back to me?
You act to be this gangsta bitch
That ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company
Now you’re always pumpin' me for information
And you tell your friends you plan on dumpin' me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
‘Cause every accusation
Makes me wanna smack your face in
See, I've never been so sure, and you're just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check 'em in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in
I need my second wind—say what?!

[Hook: Sample x8]
Jealo-!
Jealousy!
Jealousy!

[Woman's Voice: (Talking over singing)]
Fuck you and what you going through! Fuck Eminem!
He just mad ‘cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothin' but minus money
Immature, me? Nigga ain't got no dick
No swang in his thang, know what I'm sayin'?
He just mad ‘cause I'm gettin' it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm sayin'?
That's what I'm talkin' about
Motherfucker just tryin' to get this pussy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents
Until the day I started followin' your feetprints
And tappin' in your phone conversations
Through the heat vents—it made complete sense
There's someone else you like
So I confronted you and asked you, ""Who was Mike?""
And you was like, (I need a new nigga)
""Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow.""
Leavin' me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so brokenhearted
I fell apart when you departed, then the jokin' started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock
But now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, you're actin' like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
It goes, ""You didn't want me to see yo' hon
Don't want me now, take the towel, wipe your brow!""
Quit tryin' to hunt me down!
You run me down and now your tryin' to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house, y'all—fellas, sing it!

[Hook: Sample x12]
Jealo-!
Jealousy!
Jealousy!"

8 Mile: Marv Won vs B-Rabbit

[Marv Won]
Yo, yo, y'all ready for death? Y'all ready for death?
Marv Won, the Fat Killer
The game done got ugly, let's go, yo, yo
I seen your type before, you think you're tough
Battle you? Bitch, you lucky I don't beat you up
In a game of fisticuffs, I'll push your face back
You can't fuck with me, man, really, just face facts
It's him versus me in a battle of ten rounds
It's like Muggsy Bogues tryin' to fuck with Jim Brown
Dumb fuck, I'm the type to run amok
Come in the club drunk as fuck
Slap your bitch so we can buck
One hook... type of a man the size of Dan Dierdorf
Tryin' to take his ear off, like Mike Tys
I'm quite nice on fight nights
And why he poppin' shit? Man, I thought he liked life
Apparently not, I'm incoherently hot
And if I miss you then your parents get shot
Yo, I'm a bad boy, bitch, it's on
I'll put 44's on your chest like you're Rick Mahorn

[B-Rabbit]
Hold on, faggot, let me turn this mic on
Don't think for a minute I'ma let you
Get away with that song
'Cause that shit was wack, you ain't spittin'
As a matter of fact, all of that shit was written
And I know it wasn't for me
Surely, you really must adore me
Now, look it… yo, you might as well move  to Italy
Look, this guy's ripped...*skkkrr* – literally
You don't wanna really fuck with this
On this microphone, I'm not Snuffleupagus
But I don't give a fuck, you can keep that dull rap
And turn your ass back around with your fuckin' skullcap
And your bandana or your motherfuckin' sweatband
Fuckin' with this style, you're a dead man
I ain't Redman, but on this mic, yo, I pick it up
Just like your face when I had to rip it up
You don't wanna see me, yo, uh"
"[Title]
It’s Been Real

[Hook]
Thanks, it's been real
I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me...
But before I go
You know
I can't close the show
Without no closure
So before I leave...

[Eminem talking]
Yeah
I just want to take the time out to basically say
Rest In Peace to Deshaun Holton
That's my heart man
Dr. Dre
For giving me the opportunity
Just to even listen to me
To get me to this point
I wanna thank Jimmy Iovine
Interscope, Aftermath
Everybody in the whole Shady staff
Everybody who’s basically supported me from day one
Paul Rosenberg, Tracy McNew
You know I love you guys
I couldn't do it all without you
D12
Ca$his, you're gonna be a beast when you get out there man
Trust me homie, my ears don't lie to me
Who else am I forgetting
Oh yeah, Obie Trice
Bobby Creekwater, and basically man
The whole city of Detroit
8 Mile Road for making what I am today
Which basically goes back to Proof and D12
I love you guys man
Runyon Ave for holding me down when shit got thick
Oh, it wouldn't be complete, If I didn't
Thank my mom, bitch
Haha
So

[Hook (Fading)]
Thanks it's been real
I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me...
But before I go
You know
I can't close the show
Without no closure
So before I leave..."

Maxine

[Produced by Eminem & Mr. Porter]

[Intro: Maxine & Denuan Porter]
Maxine!
Hello
Can I speak to Maxine?
Yeah, this is me, what's up?
What up?
Who dis?
Denaun
Yeah, what's up?
What are you doing?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Huh?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Why?
I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I know this crack fiend, Maxine, who needs a vaccine
She tests positive, but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her, sadly, on her reputation
You're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you stepped away, son, she got her face done
Lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency 'cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, 'cause I ain't tryna hear it
While you're fightin' your fuckin' disease, tryna clear it

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life?
That is to get with every brother
And unveil one of his kids
Shit, you livin' trife
Got three kids at home, and club-hoppin' every night
You say it's gonna stop
But it just… slows… down…
And then speeds back to a regular pace
There is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hidin' in your closet?
I refrain from gettin' angry
But you keep on actin' strangely

[Verse 3: 3]
I met this girl last week
She was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her, first I cleared my throat
And said: ""Hey, bitch, haven't I seen you before?""
Looked at my nigga, turned around and got slapped
Throughout my hands, and said: ""Oh, it's like that?""
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started cryin', and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine
So I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine too
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation
That's when she asked me could I fuck
I said: ""Maxine, check this out
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out""
Got to the crib, she let me in
She didn't waste time, she grabbed my hand
And proceeded to the bedroom
I said ""Hold up, and stop proceedin', you rushin' things""
What the fuck are you doin'?
So I went for my protection
Took off my clothes and started flexin'
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about puttin' in work
Before I hit it she said: ""3, don't get mad
But there's somethin' that I gotta tell your ass""
I said ""What is it? Another nigga? It's okay""
She said: ""No I forgot to tell you
That I got AIDS, I got a problem.""

[Outro: Maxine & Denaun Porter]
Hey, Maxine
What?
You thinkin' about suckin' my dick?
Yeah, for a small price
For a small price? What you mean?
You know, money, nigga
You don't need no damn money; I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit
What you, what you hear I got?
AIDS
Who told you that bullshit?
My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Well, if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Oh for real, it's like that?
Well, I ain't got shit, so he ain't got shit
And if he do, he ain't get that shit from me
I ain't fuckin' around with no third, nigga
Fuck that, I ain't fuckin' with you
No, see…
You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Hold on, why it ain't even like that
I want y'all to get paid, fuckin'"

Kurt Loder Car Freestyle

[Eminem]
Yo, yo, I'll start it off, yo, yo…
My name is Shady, his name is Proof
Yo, we used to have a roof up on my house
And now we had a mouse that ate the cheese out of the fridge
Didn't want to admit that I was on welfare when I was three
Plus, when I was four, my mother used to leave
She used to always slam the door and say
""Goodbye, goodbye, Marshall, I'm leaving, I'm single
And right now I'm going to mingle at bingo.""
""Yeah, see you later, alligator,"" is what she said
And I would always stay at house, freezin' till I'm dead
'Cause it was cold inside that house, we never had no heat
Yo, Proof used to come walkin' up right up the street
And be like, ""Yo, what up, Em? How you doin'?""
I used be like, ""Yeah, man
It's good to see you, dawg, but my life's ruined
'Cause my mom just left,"" she left my brother Nate
And I hate the fact that we never had no food on our plate
So then Proof said: ""What up, Em?""
Yo, so I said ""Proof, won't you come in?""

[Proof]
Yeah, yeah, come in, what’s up with dat?
Tango and Cash, came to mingle and blast
Together tougher than Alcatraz prison bars
Drivin' foreign cars
Yes, it's me and my man compadre
Black and white, white and ivory and black ebony
They can't step to me, rubbery and heavenly
They can't see us in the 313 vicinity
Ayo, Em, ha ha ha ha

[Eminem]
What up? Ha, ha, I'm comin' like ha ha
I'm ill like nah nah, and y'all don't wanna see me
'Cause I'm ill with the skill
And I can grill and I always keep it real
When I built my garage back after it just got burnt down
Sorry that my parents weren't always around
But it was really hectic growin' up
But now I'm blowin' up
So it don't matter: every show I do, I'm always showin' up
To the club drunk as hell, drunk as fuck, drunk as what?
Can't say that on MTV
But remember it? Little old wimpy me
Who used to always dream to be on MTV
Now you can't see me
I know you remember that rhyme
Ayy, wait a minute, yo check it out, I'm 'bout to flatline
Pass the mic back to Proof
'Cause we get loose, we drink gin and juice
Sip it 'cause we always raise the roof

[Proof]
Ayo, ayo, we all up in your sight like cataracts
Me and Em tag-team
Beat any of y'all on some battle rap
See us next time we strippin' out your Cadillac's
How you like that? Soon you down like a battle axe

[Eminem]
I'm down like a battle axe
I got a phatter axe to smash
And I smash your cataracts
'Cause it's a Cadillac's that I be drivin'
When I be high off fuckin' vivarin
Now you can't see me 'cause I'm revivin' and survivin'
In the D, every single day in Detroit
If rappers wanna step to me, they better get to the point
'Cause they don't understand the way that I do it
The fluid that I be spittin' is never written
'Cause I'm always, always bitten, 'cause it—

[Proof]
Ayo, you make your neck crack like a snare pop
We're fresh and they're not
So give it up, don't even do this
You're wack, in fact you get flat-lined
You need practice
We stick you like a cactus
Nah, you're not a guy, you're an actress
The fact is—

[Eminem]
Here's my address, this is my old address
And called… a street called Dresden
Yo, dead presidents is what I'm resurrectin'
Gotta say what's up to Desmond and JLB
But yo, they don't help me
Do a thing, they never did
When I was a clever kid, rhymin'
I always used to go to school and climb in
The back baseball diamond

[Proof]
Hey yo, abort, hold up!
Hurt shoulder
Peace for Kurt Loder
Yeah, we're doin' an interview
In a minute or two
We're gonna enter in you

[Eminem]
In the nude, when we intrude
Don't mean to be rude
But yo, what's up, dude?
How you doin', MTV?
How you doin', Kurt?
How you doin' everybody else in the world?
You gettin' hurt
By this freestyle that I be comin' up with
Eruptin' and kick your mother in the tummy
And in the stomach

[Proof]
Ayo, ayo, and all of this we just done is freestyle
Ah, ah, ah, don't touch that dial, yeah

[Eminem]
Hold it right there, I'm your worst nightmare
Wipin' diapers on my high chair

[Proof]
What?! Yeah!

[Eminem]
When I was this big
Now I'm still bigger, but I'm skinny like a twig
Skinny little white boy
Growin' up I liked noise
I spike punch and light joints

[Proof]
Ayo, everybody looks for us to follow
We thrust the bottle, thrust the throttle
Bust a bottle over your head
Train your thoughts just like Cus d'Amato
Your guts is hollow
Back up, Proof and Em

[Eminem]
And all them wack MC's steppin' to me at Saint Andrews
Just remember that I hate you, and yo, I can't stand you

[Proof]
Yeah!

Bye bye!
Goodbye, good night!
Bye bye, good night!
Bye bye, good night!

Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye!"

Our House

[Intro: Eminem]
Here's the story, of a little boy
Growing up in a suburban home
Trying to cope with everyday life
Who lives in a little house
That was built, in the middle of the street

[Verse 1: Eminem]
""Hey, Mom! 2Pac's on the jukebox""
""So what, he shot two cops
And raped a little girl while two dudes watched""
""Nuh-uh! They were tryin' to frame him""
""You and that Tupack Shaker...""
""No! That ain't how you say his name, mom!
You're so lame, don't you know anything?""
""Yeah! I know that you'll probably go and join in a gang,""
""Yeah, right. I'm out. Where's my fuckin' Walkman at?""
""Stop cussin' at me!""
""Shut up, bitch!""
""Quit talking Black!""
Well, slammed the door and I'm out
Now, what? It's probably warm in the house
Fuck, I forgot my jacket, forgot it was winter
I'm gettin' thinner, I'm hungry
Is Mom cookin' dinner?
""Mom! Let me back in! I forgot my coat
Mom, come on, I'm not playin', it's cold!
Alright, sorry, I need a jacket
Mom, look, my 2Pac tape, I just cracked it
Ma, please let me back in
It is Tupack Shaker, I just asked him""
I'm freezin', I'm sneezin'
I'm breathin' too much cold air, I'm wheezin'
""I ain't did nothin' I didn't say 'I'm leavin'""
I said ""I'm goin' on the front porch to get somethin'""
(scissors cutting) ""Alright, here take your damn coat and leave,""
""Fine, I'll le— Mom, you cut off the sleeves!""

[Hook: Fred Durst]
Our house
In the middle of the street

[Verse 2: Eminem]
One, two, three
My teacher's two-faced, went to lower all my school grades
Since last Tuesday I had a toothache from Kool-Aid
So Mom kicked me out, and all I had in my suitcase
Was one shoelace, a tube sock, and a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool cause I could go to Fred's
Crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather just be home
In my own room alone beat my shit and nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle 'til he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
""I don't know where it is""
But as soon as Mom found it I would either be grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks and still countin'
Even when I was underage
Mom was tellin' cops I was tryin' to run away
I told her ""Someday, bitch, you're gonna pay""
Please, Mom, please, Mom, please, I wanna stay
(Let me stay)

[Hook: Fred Durst]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My brother's incoherent, Mom's a single parent
Who ain't carin', starin' through me
Like I'm transparent, made it clear
That I was just there to run her errands
Told her friends I was a son from her last marriage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
""Please, sell my step-son some cigarettes so I can smoke""
One time I tried to fake sick to get attention
Back-fired, Mom sent me to school with a vengeance
My life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me
I go to class and every teacher's always laughin' at me
And Mom says white rappers are laughed at
Not only that, she heard me upstairs
I can't rap, and I'm stupid
I'll never make it averaging a D+
I need to sit on my ass and sue people like she does
One time, I got food poison from a hot dog
Mom sued and got $2,000 from Ballpark
""Hey, Ma. You got a dollar?""
""I don't think so, now keep an eye on your brother
I'm goin' to bingo.""
""But, Mom, you said you were broke.""
""Who said? You got your ears messed up
From that damn rap music.""

We’re Back

[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady
We're back!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no, ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say ""one of the best""
I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom
Right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z
""Ayo his verses were crazy, on that 'Renegade,' b!
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady""
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the radi—
O, and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big—ba—big—big bay—ba—baby

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryna get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin the 8V at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing, no choice I chase cream, so

[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady (Stat Quo!)
We're back!

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed
My kids would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block, fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive by rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him ""suck my dick,"" I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit, nigga, I run me (I run me!)
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
That same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin' where I be
Dawg, I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the ""Detox"" LP
Feet don't fail he
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon' tell me?
A-Town's entrée Aftermath, Shady!

[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady (Bobby Creek!)
We're back!

[Verse 4: Bobby Creekwater]
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth, I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified 'till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em, 'cause I'm with him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
(None of them) stand a chance, at the dance without a bowtie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga, I'm just livin me
We the reason for the season
So I'm breezin through the track, nigga

[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady!
(Ca$his!)

[Verse 5: Ca$his]
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth, to the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way, I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, D's and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga

The Conspiracy Freestyle

Okay (Yeah)
It's about that time again (Haha)
Green Lantern (That's Right)
G-G-G-G-G Uni-*burp*
Shit!
Hahaha, Shady
We back (Invasion!) Part II
The Conspiracy

[Hook: Eminem & Green Lantern]
'Cause we ain't gonna never stop, you just keep wasting your energy
On us, you should find something to do with your time (time)
And quit fuckin' with us 'cause we ain't fuckin' with you
And it must be fuckin' with you so much you must be gone out your mind
(Shady Records mixtape, come on Em)

[Verse: Eminem]
They say I'm a day away from my entire empire crumbling
Speak up, you're mumbling, what the fuck-a you's a
Bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby, this is Shady
I know you was bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would just go away
But weeble mable weeble wobble but we don't fall down like
Jam Master Jay's two turntables, our label is just too stable
Your magazine's so motherfucking thin you using staples
To hold it together it's turning back into a newspaper
And ya'll got somethin' for my ass every issue
Thank you, 'cause I keep runnin' out of fucking tissues
And I could diss you but God I was sick of looking at you
At least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe
But-but I guess no good news is always good-good news
Moving on to bigger and better things (chicka chicka jeera)
50's blowing up, this year just keeps going up
What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady, wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone
Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
Bush has just declared the world a fucking war zone
Meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home
My fuckin' mind's blown
Trying to figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright
Especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy, ain't that right Ro'oh?
Wait a minute, I'm rambling
Back to the matter at hand, it's Green Lantern
With Elvis Presley the selfish MC
Back to ruin rap and destroy the industry
Single handedly and oh man did we
Yeah me and 50, Obie, me and Twizzy
And Nelly and Missy and Jigga
God damn, it's all a plan devised by the Man, it's a conspiracy
Against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits or ain't dope lyrically
So fuck what you heard and what you read about
We ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic, aight!
Still keep talking shit to me punk
'Cause your magazine's over in less than six months!

[Outro: Eminem]
Haha, Shady Records, still Aftermath!
And don't think we can hear you motherfuckers talking
'Cause we can't
We don't hear y'all
So we just gonna sit back for the rest of our lives
While you ride our dicks"

Emulate

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these muthafuckas acting tougher
Had enough of isolatin' myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
Now look what he became, a fool
'Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I stimulate the brain, mimic, emulate the sane
Cynics keep on thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, up Uranus
Label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
""He may seem as though he's plain normal"" if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
So he's vague, so they mistake him for bein' crazed
You part ways, your impression of him changed
You don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him; ""Peace and thanks""
You catch him flippin' you off, with his pants down
Hands around his scrotum, tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs

[Verse 3: (Verse 1 Repeated): Obie Trice]
Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose

So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up

Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It's all psychologic, why am I so maniacal?
Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick?
Or am I truly psychotic? Or my molecules just diabolical?
'Cause biologically, I defy logic, by golly, haul me off on a trolley
Probably want a quack, or I'm back on that whacky tobacca
I'ma step away from crack, Obie smacked the shit out of me
I'm so slap happy, man, snap me back to reality
I'm a walkin' art gallery, a science museum
Elephantitis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see them
I pull them out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cement
I need an ambulance, I can't just put them back in my pants (Help me!)"

Devil’s Night Intro

[Verse: Eminem]
You know it's devil's night
The way that I smash the face of a punk in
Mask of Jason is a fashion statement since Drunken
Master tapes been a basket case
And if that's the case, then I'm dunkin'
Fascination with masturbation and humpin'
Lacerations and masking tape
And I'm bumpin' some Masta Ace
Roll up posin' as pastor Mase at a luncheon
See Andrea Yates, grab her face, then I'm punchin'
Crack her fuckin' skull with an antique vase, kill her husband
To the back of the station wagon
She's dragged and placed in the trunk and
Now I'm wanted for kidnappin', rape, and abduction
Spread her legs like Land O'Lakes that I'm cuttin'
'Til every fuckin' limb's either amputated or punctured
Decapitated Christina Applegate and I rap like I'm agitated
No chill, but I'm half sedated
A functioning addict — wait, I'm in London?
Brains underwear? A pantywaist, classic case of disfunction
Aggravated assault, it was rap related, you activated a gunman
This game's over-saturated with junk and
You punks couldn't get a hit from a database with a thumbprint
Razors and matches, path is laid for destruction
Put Jason Mraz's face in his ass
Then I'm snatchin' Anne Hathaway
She scratchin' like Jam Master Jay on the one's and
Two's, I slash away, then I'm dumpin'
Her ass in a Lake Placid for alligators
After I use the fuckin' tire thumper to bash her brains in for nothin'
The murder weapons, I stash 'em away on Runyon
Man, the kind of balls that it has to take and the gumption
Lack of class displayed, but such a vast array in abundance
Of sad disgraceful and bad distasteful redundance
And, bitch, I'm hung like candy canes if you're wonderin'
Balls come at you like batting cages
I'm raw like Big Daddy Kane is, I'm comin'
Like I'm ejaculatin' and nuttin'
Come catch the clap like you're patty-cakin', lil' dumplin'
Or brace yourself like a cast and be the last to make an assumption
I'm back like I'm in the bathroom takin' a dump and
It's back in the day or somethin'
I'll shit on you, Devil's Night — how's that for a introduction?"

50 Ways

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You probably gonna think that I'm talking
About you and you're Goddamn right, I am
Look at you, this is the minimal I could diss you
Subliminally, but I think criminal instinct
Has pushed me to the brink, ""My pussy does it stink
He still loves me 'cause he puts me in his ink
He does, doesn't he? Still is, isn't he?
Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart 'cause he misses me
I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky
And there's no risk of disease 'cause he ain't with anyone, is he?""
This bitch really thinks she can get me
If she still wants me, driving across country
Strapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth
Thinking to herself ""when's the next time he's gonna punch me?""
I told this cunt she's gonna overdo it once
And once she does, she'll be stuffed up in a trunk
Crunchy, scrunched her up in a ball
Bunched up nice and comfy
Fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
You cunning little cunt, deceitful witch
You thought you had me, till my shrink told me this

[Hook: Paul Simon]
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I feel like a serial killer, I keep dumping bodies in the lake
I'mma get caught and sent up the river
I shiver when I think of the company I keep
How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep?
I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink
Sex kept us together when we slept together everything
Was all better, she made me feel like a king
Slowly she began lowering my self-esteem
She'd go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her
And I just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars
Accused me of doing drugs and scream and holla
Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
And all I know is every time I go
To them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow
The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
That's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago
And I wouldn't even let on like I know
What was I supposed to do? Call her out on it, we'd just argue
Say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script
Ooh! She's a manipulative evil bitch
A cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch
She thought she had me, till my shrink told me this

[Hook: Paul Simon]
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover"

I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit (Uh-huh)
D-Twizzy in this bitch (Haha), with Obie Trice (Woo!)
So watch what you say (Uh-huh), 'fore you call our name (Yep)
'Cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice!

Whoa, here we go, I should've known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later, you little haters
Are too jealous of us, still love us, you hate it, G-Unit made it
And Obie's coming, D-Twizzy's coming
You're sick to your stomach (""UGH!"")
Fifty percent of it's 50 Cent
The other 50 percent of it's whose color of skin it is
But if you even considering taking our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it
I'm just tryna give you a little hint for your own benefit
'Cause then it's gonna get to the point where it escalates
Into some other shit, then I'ma flip
Then I'ma get to ""Stomping in my Air Force Ones""
But you won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one
It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
You'll think Nike just made these into cleats in the shoe
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me (Woo!)
Y'all tickle me pink, I think I'd just rather have P!nk tickle me (Hehe)
Hickory-dickory-dock, tickety-tock-tickety
A little bit of the diggedy-Doc-diggedy
Mixed with a little bit of the Jigga-J-Jigga
With a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb-diggedy

Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
'Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label

Yo', do you find me live?
If you don't then that's all right, 'cause I'll just grab the microphone
And I just got to get so hype when I speak in a hyper tone
There's so many styles I might get thrown, and here's a place where I like to roam
And all the girls that I like to bone
Have the big butts, no they don't, 'cause I don't like that nigga shit

Don’t get mad, start taking' your period out on me
‘Cause I ain’t done shit to you
What’s your name, Diffusion? Well then I guess I gotta diffuse you
This ain’t something I’m used to
Why the fuck did Future even introduce you?
I really don’t understand
Why this chick is up here right now and wants to be a man

Why the fuck am I standing here battling Da Brat?

Couldn't remember it cuz I was Infinite
And I met Ken Kaniff in Connecticut

When I drove by 5 times and gave it five tries
And still missed it

Violence...complete silence is what I need in the room while I freestyle
What I need is to do...what is need is smoke weed and brew

Get..(get) yeah we come to rock....(it)
So don't get in the way cuz we gon drop....(shit)
Now how you feel right now we bust yo..op....(tic)....(tock)
We lunatics with mics and we dont stop we come to rock
The dirty dozen is non-stop
To the top from tree tops to ewoks that pop Reeboks
And men with pre-ops
Yo now there is 3-Pac's
Master P....Thug Life and now it's 2pac
Get back to that one...here goes the rhyme that you dropped

[Eminem]
The rhyme that I dropped is stickin up IHOP
In high tops and walking around like a one-eyed Cyclops
And you can't see me....I only got one eye and I can still see you
You can even give it a dumb try...If you're a dumb guy then come try this
But I rock the microphone with my flyness
So get off my jock..get of my cock..when I sky rock ...it in sky
Rock..shit...bitch

[Proof]
Ayo...a lot of people always try to tell us...that we gonna be better or failures
But me or Slim yo you can't tell me
You try to freestyle son we gon' put these verses on your LP
Slow down with that old stuff....I heard the most of y'all is Mos Def

[Eminem]
My LP...my whole LP...tha last one was screaming help me
You couldn't melt me if you was Vanilla Ice...Yo guess what
My Nuuuuuuuuutz!!
Here I go with the lyrical miracle...spiritual spirital...you dont wanna hear it though
I rickety rock the microphone
Don't do it dont do it cuz that shit is stupid...I knew it
I take a beat and loop it...I take a beat and troop it
What the fuck did that mean...I dont know but I got phat jeans on
And I already said that but I dont know where my head's at
All I wanna do is go back to the hotel and know where my bed's at

[Proof]
Yo wheres the beds at so we can relax and catch Ease
Y'all dont want none of tha dirty Deez
From the 3-1's its for the three of thirds
One third MC yo we smoke y'all like herbs
Under the curb early morn take it to born
Y'all get broke up...put back together ...re-enact it
Some times you see this...you just a faggot
No need to tag it...wit more loot that Jimmy Swagart

[Eminem]
Faggot....uh oh...was that homophobic...?
But no one knows it...and I'm so homophobic
I won't even throw clothes in the closet
Fuck it...I've lost it....I'm holocausted...see my face it's written all
Acrossed it
This beer makes me wanna disappear this year
I'm so high I'm 'bout to die...and I'm so tired I'm 'bout to fry
You're so fired you're down

[Proof]
Hey....it's me...it's the hamster man
Coming all the way from Amsterdam
And I come to tell you all a little secret
So you can ........eat it ....you got to grab your crackers
{mumbling}

[Eminem]
Quit spittin your writ shit bitch I'll kill you and kick you
In your motherfuckin' dick and your clit...you little pussy
Hermaphrodite with no appetite
And you ain't rappin' right but you was taking rapid bites
Of my dick when you was on it...my brain is haunted
I walk up in a place in a T-shirt wit my stains on it
But I dont give a damn...give a fuck...give a shit...give a hell
Give a piss give a dick give a lick

[Proof]
Yea....live and direct it's us
You better back up

[Eminem]
You better back up before I jack off
Back off before I jack off

[Proof]
You better back off before he jack off (laughing)
You better back off before I jack off

[Eminem]
Colder than Jack Frost...smack you across your face
While I'm still jackin off
Sittin' in the closet beatin' my shit
Ain't got nuttin' else to do cuz I'm thinkin' of a bitch
Wait a minute ...oh shit she's here
Look who walked in the door....come in it's Britney Spears!!!!
(Ken Kaniff)
Oh....come here little girl
Come here little girl

[Eminem]
What happened? (I dunno)
We stopped rappin' (Oh it's clappin')
Gun clappin' ...and all I need is one napkin to wipe the cum off
When I come off with the drum off
Whatever the hell that meant...but I can still speak wit' a accent
A French accent
Excuse my French but
Suck my dick touche le le poo...uhh....bitch

[Proof]
Bonjour...I'm here with the cure...Oh yea lets rock it for the drawer
Hey Em...how you doin this is me...The Em jock...get off my
Damn cock

[Eminem]
Yo while you're spraying verbs...you ain't even fuckin' saying words
(THuuuG) Pronounce your words right...and you can ride around curbs
And bounce your herbs tight
What the fuck ? (Yo somethin' is in the beat that keeps talkin')
Yo put another beat on before you get peed on

[Proof]
Yo are we done or what? They want us to freestyle for 45 min—

[Eminem]
Hi...Hi.... My name is ...my name is...my name is
Slim Shady...Slim Shady...Bitch you're little just like that Kim lady
And I'm in sky rock radio...the shadiest bro on the radio
But you dont hear me though"

Everything

[Intro]
CDs ain't selling no more anyways, man
Look at SoundScan
I really don't think it matters if

[Hook]
Everything I do is number one, that makes you two
And that spells trouble for me and you
'Cause that's how beef starts between crews
And I don't mind if I debut at number two
So why do you? If we make money
Then why can't you be satisfied with what you do?

[Verse]
It's like our legacy's pregnant, we're planting eggs every record
They're beggin' me to release a CD every other second
But don't expect it, 'cause every time I get hit with that question
I just deflect it, get Ca$his or 50's record and check it
And Buck is out, like get these motherfuckers out 'fore I smack 'em
Plus T.I. just dropped an album now, go out and get that one
And I got a whole stable of artists who's able and fully capable
Of holdin' a label 'til I figure out when I'm ready to drop
Or maybe not, Shady, look how hot,  you were on top
You were pop, you were so popular, now you're not
You're a washed up entrepreneur, how's it possible?
Well, it's not, if your little fickle minds would've caught on, but you didn't
See, I don't rap for the green, I mean, I ain't greedy
But I also know what it's like to be needy, and I will never
Go back to poverty, see, it ain't easy to try to step
Away from entertainment, separate it from CDs
And every day it just seems like we're beefin', even the media's
Meat eaters, they gotta give you something to read
Or you won't buy it, believe what you wanna believe
Let 'em feed to you, the BS, P.S., peace to T.I
You gon be 'aight and we out

[Hook]
Everything I do is number one, that makes you two
And that spells trouble for me and you
'Cause that's how beef starts between crews
And I don't mind if I debut at number two
So why do you? If we make money
Then why can't you be satisfied with what you do?

[Outro]
Peace
Hold a head up, partner
You know how we do what we gonna do
When we do it and we don't give a fuck what you're doin'
We gon' touchdown, back up in the private charter plane
We gon' touchdown, you know we gon' get it crackin' man
We gon' touchdown, I told you ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
With T.I. and Shady, baby, they gon' make a bigger riot
When we touchdown"
"[Title]
Fuck You

[Intro: Noreaga]
Yea, yea, we back again, we doin' our shit, yo
Word up, I wanna hear some fly shit
You know what I'm sayin', some get high shit
Word up, I wanna hear some white boy shit, man
Yo, I wanna hear some Eminem, man
Talkin' about all that shit he be doin'

[Hook: Slim Shady]
You ain't into fuckin' drugs, fuck you
You don't do ecstasy, fuck you
You don't pop mushrooms, fuck you
If you don't wanna tab of acid, fuck you

[Verse 1: Slim Shady]
I'm nauseous in this place, I need some office space
The boss is late, I wanna slap the mustache right off his face
I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close
I can almost feel his throat with no pulse when I choke him
In ten seconds I'mma turn into Hulk Hogan
With a cigarette in his mouth
He tells me there's no smokin'
I'm sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
All I picture is kickin' his ass
When he's taking his ashes and flickin' 'em
I'm sick of these stamps
I'm sick of lickin' 'em, sick of stickin' 'em
I'm sick of lookin' at 'em, I'm sick of 'em
""Alright, Mr. Mathers, pick 'em up!""
No you pick 'em up! Bitch, stick 'em up
Get against the wall, senior citizens and all
I can't take this shit no more, everybody hit the floor
Get the door, close it and lock it
Put your wallets back in your pocket, I don't want dollars
Ain't none of us walkin' out of this office

[Hook: Slim Shady]
Faggot, fuck you, work at the post office, fuck you
Talkin' shit to me, tellin' me to take out
The goddamn garbage, fuck you
If you're a fuckin' dick, fuck you
If you're a white rapper, fuck you
Talk shit about Stretch? You're cool
But if you don't talk shit about Stretch, fuck you
If you're a fuckin' punk, fuck you
Talk shit about me, fuck you
You wanna battle me, fuck you
I ain't got to say shit to you but fuck you"

Rap City Freestyle (Keeping It Raw)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm keepin' it raw, illegal like Malik and Jamal
Cause I don't believe in the law, like I'm Steven Seagal
Flippin' off the police while I'm leapin' a wall
Take some Tylenol, then fall asleep in a mall
I got ya little son, you'll be receivin' a call
You lucky this little punks still breathin' at all
Fuck the world, this how I get even at y'all
Pop shit, get rolled up and leave in a ball
I hit you in your mouth and sink ya teeth in ya jaws
You won't be able to eat shit, not even a malt
This lethal assault, is givin' you a reason to stall
I'm cockin' this deuce deuce and I'm squeezin' it off
At the first burp, fart sniffle a sneeze and a cough
Get your arm chewed off like you was teasin' a dog
I'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and unthaw
I'll kick my girl out, in 10 degrees in her bra
You faggots turn yellow like the trees in the fall
I'm shittin' on rappers, (Where's Shady?) he's in the stall
All that's left of your niece is a piece of her doll
And all that's left of her puppy is a leash and a paw"

Nut Up

[Intro]
Ayy, Em
Yeah!

[Chorus]
So, Slim Shady, to the stage, please
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
You know what you doin' when you do it for the ladies
So, ladies, this ain't the place to be in if you're lazy (Get up!)
I said, ""Shady, to the stage please""
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
You know what you doin' when you do it for the ladies
So won't you please step up to the mic, baby?

[Verse 1]
It's been a little boring lately
I've been playing in poison ivy and pee
I've been itching to get in some S-H-I-T
You heard what I S-A-I-D
This club? I guess they I.D.​
But they just let me in without it, so I guess they like me
I put on my best dang white tee for this evening's festivities
And I even got it pressed and dry-cleaned
It's me and the rest of my heathens, we in the building
'Til it closes, we're partying 'til then nobody knows that I'm drinking
Keep my Bacardi concealed inside of my jacket
When no one's looking, I tap the bottle, crack it, then swig it then put the frigging top back on it and cap it
Yeah, that same bullshit, man, I just got back on it, god dammit
Boy, you don't want it, doggone it, that gin and tonic, I slam it
An alcoholic, I am what I am, that's all that I am
And upon my further inspection, Monica's bra I examine
And if you're wondering why I'm looking in awe as I am
It's 'cause I'm just so overjoyed to see people brawl to my jam
And now let's go

[Chorus]
So, Slim Shady, to the stage please
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
If you know what you doin', fellas, turn to the ladies
And tell 'em, ""You just the hit the lottery, baby""
I said, ""Shady, to the stage please""
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
We heard the fellas, now let's hear it from the ladies
Say, ""You just the hit the fucking lottery, baby""

[Verse 2]
Man, I hate it when no one's paying me any attention
So I won't let up 'til they do, I don't have any intention
Ma, I like your breast, but your booty's too skinny to pinch it
How is that possible with a waist on me about 26 inches?
Ease up on the Henny, just sip it
There's so many winches up in here that's got my interest
I'm drenched in sweat down in the trenches
Continue to make my way all the way to the center of the dance floor I've just entered
Hope that I don't get injured, oh, here I go
I'm shaking my tail for the oh-so member
Oh, feet, don't fail me now
Better be nimble when you swoop this bimb' up
Get the info on the nympho dudes went for 'cause of the way he pimped up
Shady's Mercedes Benz with the crazy rims got the ladies trembling
Like a gremlin with a head full of Red Bull at 12:15 AM and
Dude, I feel incredible, is medicine edible? You are unforgettable
Girl, the fact we didn't meet sooner is the only thing that I think's regrettable
Let me check my schedule (Shit)
Oh no, your phone number ain't even legible, this night's unmeasurable
It'd be my pleasure to introduce you to

[Chorus]
Slim Shady, to the stage please
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
If you know what you doin', fellas, turn to the ladies
And tell 'em, ""You just the hit the lottery, baby""
I said, ""Shady, to the stage please""
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
We heard the fellas, now let's hear it from the ladies
Say, ""You just the hit the fucking lottery, baby""

[Verse 3]
So when you come in the club, don't care if you paid or you snuck in
Soon as you hear the beat drop, stop what you doing, start buckin'
So get up like you're up and, homie, get down like you're ducking
Up like you're stuck in the air and down like you're down on your luck
And not down like out, so just turn that frown upside down that you're stuck in
There's no upside when you're down
The only downside when you're up is being hungover
So, Shady, won't tell you 'em what's up?
Then go get your cup and refill it
Now speed it up a little bit and just kill it
Don't stand there and look at my whip, chick, get in
I ain't gotta tell you again, now close the door, you're lettin' flies in
What? Am I supposed to be air conditioning the whole outside then?
Would you look at what you're riding in?
You better take pride and stare at it for five minutes
You're lucky I didn't just drive by in it
You're privileged just to be inside of it
I stepped in this party to liven it
I just caught a vibe in it the minute that I arrived in it
So, ladies, where you at? Make some noise if you're likin' it
Then tell your boyfriend to take a hike again
Two Heinekens and you're mine
So, Slim Shady, won't you please step to the mic again? (Come on)

[Chorus]
So, Slim Shady, to the stage please
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
If you know what you doin', fellas, turn to the ladies
And tell 'em, ""You just the hit the lottery, baby""
I said, ""Shady, to the stage please""
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
We heard the fellas, now let's hear it from the ladies
Say, ""You just the hit the fucking lottery, baby"""

Give Me the Ball

[Verse 1: Eminem]
My name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver, my crew's liver when you can't sleep and you're still up
I get the ball and I'm like Rip, you can't get a grip
You probably got stripped, you wanna rumble, no reason to trip
I grab her like Gnarls Barkley holds the mic, your snarls spark me
I smile like Charles Barkley come on I'm hard, guard me
Ain’t booin’, ain’t pursuin’, no lawsuits, I ain’t suin’
I know what I’m doin’, give me the ball and your life is ruined
I'm like Rasheed, I remind me the spirit of Proof
I'm happy and lucky, ballin' and groovin', I'm on the move
I'm smooth with it, give me the ball, you don't know what to do with it
Shoot it in the basket, you other teams need a casket
LeBron sayin' don't respond, there's no back and forth
This game is mental, man, I play aloud and walk away just to hush the crowd
You trying to touch? Sit down

[Hook: Eminem]
Detroit basketball
Homie like I told you this is Detroit basketball
Man I don't think you ready for the

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I get the crowd rolled up Like a U-Haul truck
Just call me 2 Ball Chuck, ain't too tall what
I'll leave Utah stuffed
Man I love this game, who the hell you called up?
You need points on the paint, I'm the joints when they stained
All my coins in the bank and we're going all the way
Yeah baby it's true, I'm talking to you
You already know what to do
Just pass to me, it just so happens to be
That I adapt with this heat so strap in your seat
I got a grasp on this beat, you ain't convinced?
Give it to Tayshaun Prince, we haven't stayed calm since
Leave the ball with delayed palm prints

[Hook: Eminem]
Detroit basketball
Homie like I told you this is Detroit basketball
Man I don't think you ready for the

[Outro: Eminem]
We get everybody involved, homie, we get everybody involved
I said, we get everybody involved, homie, we get everybody involved
Yeah
Ahh
I said, ahh
Give me the ball
You gotta walk before you crawl
Tell me you ain't listenin'
This is Detroit basketball, homie, hey, yo'
Beam me up, Scottie
Hahahahahahahahahahaha!"

Uh, uh, uh, play that shit
What the fuck you doing Stretch
Gotta stretch your neck
You better protect it
I’mma Inspectah Deck
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho

[Verse 1]
Paul Where’s my words at
Yo see Slim Shady yo, where the birds at
Being flipped the middle ones
Rappers get these little ones in they mouth
These little nuts, yeah
Shit, I don’t care I ain’t afraid to admit it
I got a little dick yeah, but so do you
You scared to admit it
You won’t spit it on this mother friggen mic
Cause I will strike and smack your ass like a friggen fag
And I don’t care if you get offended
I never pretended to rock this microphone beef
You wanna start it now we’ll end it
Cause when I slip in the zone up on this microphone
People want me to do a written rap but fuck that go home
I don’t really give a damn I’ll kick right off of the top
And everything that I drop always gonna remain hot
Let on the spot, Slim, I mean woops, Grim it’s when im dim
Yo, I’m in affect mode
Rappers get they neck sewed
Get they whole threshold fucked up
Get they damn fleshed sewed
Ha, ha
I busted, I kill it, I crush it, I do it, the fluid, I spill it, I’m ill wit
These motherfucking rhymes that I be coming with and running with and kick you in yo motherfucking stomach with bitch
Cause you don’t want none of it
Rappers always try but they always die
And rappers always look to me and tried to lie
(Arf, Arf)
Yo, where my dogs at
Yo (err, ribbit) where my frogs at
In the house, It really doesn’t matter cause I still turn it out
When I step on this mic, smacking your spouse
Ha, Ha
The illest MC to come off the top
When I get this drum off
Yo Strech give me a break, let me catch my friggen breath
And till` the death, bust rhymes till` there’s none left
I’m wanted for theft and robbery
And probably smack a bitch up in the lobby G
Cause she don’t want none of me
I’m the illest MC to ever hold a cordless on the planet earth and you’ll see
That I’m from the friggen D
Ya’ll don’t get my point I’m from Detroit
Smoke your fake ass like a joint
That’s the first simplest rhyme I ever said in my life
But, at the end of the night I’ll still be fucking your wife
Shit, I really don’t care your style needs to switch
Cause you ain’t rich, that’s why you ain’t rich
Remain underground, can’t come off the top
You can’t drop rhymes nonstop like this
I might twist my friggen dick up in your ear
Rappers always wanna stand clear
I’m a motherfucking landmine
Ya’ll don’t understand mine
I’m Slim Shady showing out like my tan line
Ha, ha
The illest MC to rhyme
Every time the illest MC of our time
I rhyme time and time twice but I’m nice
With this mic device I slice right through your Adams apple
I had a Snapple and a motherfriggen syringe
Up in the bathroom I shouldn’t have but yo I boinked
To any MC up in this shit who want some
To any MC who wanna step up and get some
Get done, fuck competition
Let me catch my breath one more time
Yo, I’m on a mission
To stomp any MC comp I just trunked
And swamp is this truamp a word?, no its not
Yo, but here I go with this lyrical, lyricols, spiritual flows, that I flow so hysterical
Driving MC’s crazy, Slim Shady, up in your motherfucking radio baby"

Kill My Pain (Mixup)

[Eminem]
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them

[Evanescene] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[Notorious B.I.G]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make
(I repeat)
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make

[Evanescence] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

[Evanescence] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
Theyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villains
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillin
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you doubted me hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place

Freestyle (Gone Crazy)

Die Bitches, Check it out bitches
All you bitch ass rappers
Need to get your clit repierced, Look at me, hip, I'm Britney Spears
Look at the way I wear my mascara
How you doing
I'm Pristina Gaguilera, And I sing songs about a genie in a bottle
And I'm Britney Spears
I got big tits, I'm a role model
To all little kids
But I got breast implants
That was the only way to get my chest enhanced
And here I go with the lyrical, miracle, spiritual everytime im incredible
With freestyles from the top that I drop
And my instinct
Is to kill N'Sync
And the Backstreet Boys
It really doesn't matter coz' I got a scratchy voice
Yo, check it out
But you ask me I ain't gonna be happy til' I see every member of the Backstreet Boys
Getting their ass beat
In the back seat of a taxi, And dropped of on the real backstreet
And somebody black sees five little rich white boys
Looking like faggots
With the N-word painted on the back of their jackets

[Proof]

Ohhhhh
And god damn it
Can't stop there
What's up?
It's over
And this just Some Bacardi and Mountain Dew

Timing is everything, and it seems to be the key
To my success, I merked for me repeatedly
(GreenLantern) “The evil genius”
We done be, to beat MC’s
Timing is everything, and it seems to be the key
Let 'em diss you first and respond immediately

Ain't got no more targets, shit, Irv and Jeff
We done beat 'em to death, Benzino in debt
There seems to just be no one left to bully; Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush? Puss is bushy!
Ain't shit going on, shit, I've been getting so bored lately
I'm thinking of doing some shit to get you to go and hate me again
Tell the truth, I liked the shit better then, shit, I could spit better
I'm 'bout to kick this sick shit again, look:
The game just ain't the same, it's changing
Shit, Dre is quitting, Jay is quitting, now it's just wankstas
Just saying the same shit, it's fake and it's ancient
And it's making me so bored I'mma just make a new language

Got the belt for the welterweight champ
You got in with a fake stamp
Garbage bag full of clothes, still pullin' hoes
Rip you from head to toe, from leg to bullet hole
Next gun pull it slow
And aim at the Free World 'fore you let it go
Instead of ""Oh, I just shot my dick head""
And yes, you do got a big head

Get stuck fucking with us
'Cause....
We don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Kon Artis]
Oh, we sound like Em clones, huh?
Where the fuck you think he started at holmes, huh?
Skip the small talk, talking is a risk you take
Kick yo' face 'till yo' head go through this window and break
Break to the 1-9, Denaun cause the gun-line
And collect bank from every weed spot like I'm one time
I'm ain't the remorseful type, I'll drink and still drive prone to hit anything at any given night
Fuck leaving my roots, I'm still in cahoots with nincompoops who shoot out like troops in Beirut
Pull up in a red hearse with Fred Durst dressed like a nurse
With a coach purse screaming his throat hurts

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
On my Harley Davidson, I ride down Main Street
I speed with my dad's name on my ass cheek
Gimme your ones and get robbed with a broken gun
Got you doing more dances than Puffy's son
All you groupies that wanna get took
You gotta be 12 years old with a coloring book
And anyone else who wanna get fucked, 'cause
(Yeah bitch, oh shit!)

Get stuck fucking with us

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We interrupt your little world of perfectness
To bring you the shit to murder conservatives with
To curse and diss, with verses so merciless
These words can just fuck up your high worse than this
{Police Sirens}
I've killed for less, and dumped bodies in the motherfuckin' wilderness
I'm a wildebeest, and I've concealed a piece even after I was busted by Warren Police
You think just because I got caught by these cops once
I'm not gonna carry shotguns to blow your wigs back like hamburgers without any top buns
So many damn murders I can't even count one
Two black guns, I don't know maybe they're Magnums
I don't know what the fuck they're called, I just grab them
12-gauge dumps in a drug-fueled rage, fuck age, still goin' through my ""fuck-you"" stage
I'm a 27-year-old eleven-year-old, I'mma never grow up, bitch, I ain't gon' ever get old
I'll be sitting here with a cane and a beard
Still insane and as weird as the day I came in here, brain in my rear, yeah
So until I'm wrinkled as Robert Van Winkle, I'mma drop a damn single every goddamn week, people
It's D12, June 19th, so do like me, and go buy three, with no ID
Kids

[Verse 4: Proof]
Now why you wanna play a game with me, dangerously
The outcome's hot, once split your brain in three
Proof with crooked raps, always ask them ""What the fuck you lookin' at""?
And invite the hook to scrap
I gave my life to God, nigga, then I took it back
Move it black, this fuckin' gat'll leave your cookie cracked
Detroit's derelict arrogant terrorist, straight on you aerospit
Spit at various people to leave you with a body to get buried with
Every hit was serious, niggas wanna know how murderous the Dirty Harry is
When I'm on your front porch with guns about to bust

[Verse 5: Swift]
When they run into Swift they change directions
My shit so tight when hoes hear it they catch a yeast infection
You need protection, you gon' fear it
I snatch away yo' DNA from existence, with no spirit
Give up the carats or see the nine
Fuckin' with mine is like Farakhan chewin' up swine, on Christmas
With a white trailer bitch on his arm, chillin' in Europe, havin dinner with a Uncle Tom
I attack killin', fuckin' hoes like Matt Dillon
Stackin' obituaries higher than Michael Jackson's ceiling
I leaves nobody livin', I got Satan shiverin'
Hate what I'm deliverin', you know the best then send 'em in, crack you with a fifth of gin
You got your men, but they all wearin' skirts like them niggas from Scotland, you hoes are not grim
Don't make me stop in with a mag, and blow yo feet up out yo Top Tens

[Verse 6: Kuniva]
I'm the one they call in to torture ya
Smackin' your bitch and forcin' her in the back seat of an old Corcia
Kuniva's the silent type, but under the silence is a violent life, usually followed by sirens and lights
Get your throat cut by this tyrant's knife, from high as a kite
And my get-a-way driver's drivin' right
Fuckin' with Hans will get you flipped like a baton, the deadliest bombs
Wrap around niggas like Camabons, you know I ain't nothin' to play with
Thinkin' you real like The Matrix, fuckin' with niggas drippin' off self-hatred
I'm on some live shit, rappers be on some ""Ready To Die"" shit
'Till I put a ice pick, right through they eyelids, fuck heaters, I'll knock you out instead of shootin'
I hit hard, break yo' fuckin' jaw like Resolution
Give up the cash and coat, or get your little brother's classroom smoked
And the substitue gagged and choked

Pooh Butt Day

[Verse 1: Chaos Kid]
Get up this morning, I'm feeling sleepy as all hell
Went to use the bathroom when I tripped and I fell
All the way downstairs and onto the couch
And I pissed my pants on the way down South
So I went back upstairs to change my underwear
Took a while to get 'em unstuck from my pubic hair
Finally got unzipped I went to put 'em down the street
But then I threw 'em in the garbage cause it all said ""pew""
Hopped in the shower put shampoo in my hair
Went to rinse it out but then the water wasn't there
That damn toilet it must'a went foul
Got another bath to wipe the stuff up with the towel
Went to get my clothes but I couldn't wear the wash
So I sat and played some Mario on my Nintendo
I was gonna see my girl but I forget that stuff
Man today I just feel like a pooh butt...

[Hook: Chaos Kid]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I-I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I-I just feel like a pooh butt today

[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
Now every single day I make habits to get up
But today I just feel like a pooh butt
So ill stay in bed I dont know whats wrong with me
I'm just taking everything nonchalantly
I just feel like I can't move one muscle
My girlfriend calls me up and tells me now we gotta hustle
My plane leaves to roll about quarter to 8
It's 7:15 looks like I'm gonna be late
Aw, forget that baby said I just can't make it
I know you're disappointed but your gonna have to take it
I'm sick in bed I'm making [air-fair footer?]
But before I hung up the phone she told me where I could put it
Comes next day I got a call from M&M he said
(We gotta make a record get ya butt outta bed)
I said ""I ain't doin nothing I wish you nothing but luck,"" he said (What's up?) I said I feel like a pooh but...

[Hook]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I-I just feel like a pooh butt today

[Break: Chaos Kid, M&M]
Yo, you ever have one of those poohie stinky ridiculous rotten days, M&M?
Man I had one once, check this out:

[Verse 3: M&M]
Woke up, 6:30 in the morning, yawning
Gotta get to the recording studio
I gotta get a take done
Put all my rhymes together so I can make one
Get outta bed, fall on my head
Slipped on the rug, I thought I was dead
Cussin', I think my head is busted but it's really nothing
Only a concussion, shake it off, get off the ground
Look around couldn't find my rhyme sheets; Where'd I put em down?
They were just there last night on the chair
Had to look everywhere but couldn't find em anywhere
Go to the basement might of misplaced em
Gotta find em in hurry but my visions still blurry
Goin' down the stairs what could happen next
But, when its this early you can't skip steps;
Fallin head first -- As I fall, I curse
Things are lookin' bad, I'mma only get worse;
Aching I shake and I hurt I stand up slowly
Wiped all the dirt off memory lapse
I can't remember nothing, think I'll collapse
If you forget the whole thing pause for a second
What was I looking for?
Oh yeah, my rhyme sheets; they might be on the floor
Or on the chair
Wait a minute where am I? I'm in a basement
Damn, how does time fly?
Think for a second, recall my memory
If I was a rhyme sheet where would I be??
Now I remember I put em in the closet next to my jacket
So I would'a never lost em
Already 7? I've only got an hour to eat breakfast
Get dressed, plus take a shower got undressed
Got the zest off the rack
Turn the water on and I almost had a heart attack;
Cold as hell, started to yell jumped out the shower
And said fuck it, I'll smell
Grabbed the towel off the rack, dried off got dressed
Still had to eat but my hair was a mess
I was in a rush, grabbed the brush
And ran into the door on the floor I land
Always to fate now; I know I'm cursed
I think it might help if I open the door first
Tried to turn the handle but I sprained my wrist
But that's what happens on a day like this...

[Hook: M&M]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today

[Break: Chaos Kid, M&M]
Wow, that sounds pretty poohie to me
Now, I'm gonna break it down for all the people who don't know what a pooh butt day is

[Verse 4: M&M]
Now, a pooh butt day is something everybody's had
No particular depression neither mad or sad
You couldn't see your butt because your butt is what it is
Cause when your feeling like a pooh butt
Then you're feeling like shit
They come up at a certain time, they don't have a season
But most of the time you feel like one for no particular reason
They get a careless attitude the yucky sensations
Some people won't accept love in a pooh-y situation
Sittin' on the toilet for an hour or so
Marks on the butt from the seat or the bowl
Grab a toilet paper and the seat and just wipe
When I realize I may have sat the in the seat too tight
So I shrug and shake from a stuck position
But removing myself was an impossible mission
Screaming to get out I couldn't take it any more
When my mother arrived and knocked upon the door
We pulled and pulled and I was removed from the seat
I couldn't sit down for a whole damn week!
Never again will I get caught in that rut
So I can stay fresh instead of feeling like a pooh but

[Hook: M&M]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I-I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I-I just feel like a pooh butt today

[Verse 5: M&M, Chaos Kid]
Well the very next day, [Unintelligible]
Felt the pooh butt sick but am I defeated I survived
So I went downstairs and managed not to fall
Since I was feeling better I can manage the car
Well, [?] said ""Oh,"" says
""Ey s-wzup whut up, you gotta go?""
""I'm feeling pretty good, what about if I come over?
We can practice for a while [know the piece are you sober?]""
He said: ""I gotta no, nope, I'm not going
Wanna know the reason [?]
Because I got the money I got something to do but uhh
If you could smell the way I'm seeying you'd be saying 'pew!'""
I thought for a second and I said, ""I don't get it""
Manic said, ""[?] holes in the sweater
I don't feel like doin' nothing but I [?]
Don't be comin' over feelin' 'cause i'm feeling like pooh!""
Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh
Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh

[Hook: Chaos Kid]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I-I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I-I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
I just feel like a pooh butt today!
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today!

[Outro: Chaos Kid, M&M]
Pooh butt! I feel like a pooh butt!
Sometimes I feel like a pooh butt!
When you just can't get up
When you feel like you want to stay in bed all day
That's an example of a pooh but day
Ooooooh, pooh butt, oh!
My example of a pooh butt day
Is when you have a foot falls asleep, for the whole day
But you've got a track run at one o'clock!
You know what pisses me off, is when we get all the parts down except James gets a lag on his throat and he fucks up, and you know what else pisses me off is, whatever's pissing me off in that particular moment, that's what's usually pissing me off
I'm gonna end this song by saying, uh
Pooh buuutt!"

Things just ain't the same for psychos
Guns and rifles, sharp knifes, I like those
I might just O.D. by the end of tonight's show
With the right dose I might wipe out this light pole
But, the strangest things can happen from jabbin'
Pregnant women in the abdomen so they can't have children
Bitches get slapped up and drastic ass kicks
Gay-bashin' fags with tire irons and ratchets
I seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Versace ""Whoa, hey!"" Liberace ""ho!"" (echoes)
I might have bashed of somebody you probably know
Buncha' faggots in your clique screamin' ""It's not me! No!""
Drag 'em out the closet and across the floor
Went you paid 'em a visit in the hospital
Stab 'em in the fuckin' tonsils with a popsicle
Stick, and sit back and watch 'em choke

[Hook]
Cause every chair that I throw
People sue me for dough
They press charges on me
Till I can’t fight anymore
But every girl that I choke
I got lawyers I know
Who got judges they know
So I suggest you stay home

Tim Westwood Freestyle

{Freestyle over Jay-Z's 'So Ghetto'}

[Intro: Eminem (Proof)]
Yeah. Now I'm getting distorted. (Can you turn it down) When I was...I should've been aborted. But it was too late...uh oh. (Uh oh) Yo, just turn up the beat a little bit. I don't care if the mic is distorted. Fuck it

[Eminem]
That's it, that's it, gotta hit than pass it
I'm blasted off a tab of acid
Flabbergasted
Hopped in a cab and blasted the cab driver
I said...haha
Hold on a minute
Give me infinite beats that I can kick for a minute
Y'all don't understand
The way that I got this mic in my hand
Killing any MC who stands or sits or walks
Or is handicapped
It doesn't matter, Mr. Handicap, hand me that
Haha
I clap hands with the rap fans
Jump in their wheelchairs and give 'em a lap dance
I'm the illest MC who will kill this
And what?
And Die Hard like who?
(Bruce Willis)
Thank you very much that's a fucking cliche
But I will rock the microphone and don't care about what he say
Or they say or I say or we say or them say
Eminem say shit that only Slim say
Or Slim says
Fuck a les
-bian in her ass
Korean or a...
Haha

[Interlude: Proof talking]
Ayo, let me try something. Uh uh uh uh uh uh. I'm not free in here, check it out

[Proof]
I rap if there was no rap within a soul clap
Expose wack rappers and smack 'em with my bozack
Flatten 'em like inner tubes
Punch my fist through the torso of thinner dudes
And when I'm in the mood make a serious winner lose
Get high of gin and booze

[Eminem]
Hahahaha
In an inner tube
While I'm in the nude
With a centerfold
In the winter cold

[Proof]
Ayo we give it though
Give me an envelope
I get open with Tim Westwood show
And Cypher Sounds I strike you down
Don't like the way you sound, you wack now
You got my style packed down or should I say down pack
Any MC's will tell you right now that you sound wack
Call us up and then we make noise then see shells
We shall prevail you faker than Lee Nails
And we tell D-12 to all those that don't know
Flow for flow we rocking your radio
How you feel right now?
C'mon Shady flow
Yo, yo, yo

[Interlude: Eminem and Proof talking]
[E] Yo, turn the beat up a little bit
[P] I know, it's like the beat is like mad low
[E] Hello, hello, hello, check, check, check
[P] Hello
[E] Check, check, check

{beat switches to LL Cool J's 'Ill Bomb'}

[E] What, what?
[P] Awwww shit
[E] Yo, turn it up a little bit
[P] Yeah, just turn it up, up, up, up
[Cypher Sounds] C'mon Tim turn it up
[E] Yeah, just turn it up Tim
[P] Let it be distorted. Yo, yo, yo

[Eminem]
Trapped in a cinema, in a material world
Criminal, cops scour the rural area thorough
Cause I kissed a girl, married a girl
Carried a girl to the cemetery, buried a girl
And I'm desperate, no one to mess with
Always get arrested for something domestic
And I kill the way you met me
You'll never catch me, cops can't sketch me
You can't upset me, no matter how bad
How mad you get me
Problem with y'all, I'm letting the Tec speak
Went from sweet to hard
Beat the odds
From no hoes to show, quit the pizza job
No more fools to rob, no more geeks to rob
No more stolen cars, no more Visa cards
(Visa cards)

8 Mile: Maurice Grant vs B-Rabbit

[Maurice Grant]
The Shelter
Let me get up in this nigga like smashin'
With a red beam Johny blastin'
Evil is the rhyme assassin
Get a guy runnin', like haulin' ass
Bury you pink rabbits for askin'
Closed caption nigga don't say a word
When these flames get to burnin' up
Burnin' you down
Leavin' you ground tore up
From the pressure
Wanna frown
Don't want the nigga known pullin' triggers
Hoist this fool on my neck back-break this nigga

[B-Rabbit]
Yo
Check it out
Look, look
Yo, I gotta flow
I'm from the Mo, you ain't Detroit, hoe
Talkin' about seven mile, change your style
I read your bio, you're really from Ohio
I'm vile
This guy's so fuckin' fat I can't even see his eyes when he smiles
Yo, listen to this
Motherfuckin' rhyme, yo chicken, we can do this
As a matter of fact have another beer
I'll be right back, dawg, I'ma set the mic right here"

Tylenol Island

[Intro: Eminem]
Slim motherfuckin' Shady
A'ight
Missy Elliott, Timbo, c'mon, yo

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm homicidal and suicidal, with no friends
Holding a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' TECs at you until you see your fuckin' legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin' next to you
Fuckin' mad dog, foamin' at the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin' at the couch
Jumped out of the ninety-third floor of a buildin'
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground (Keep filmin'!)
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed
Chopped 'em in half and suffocated your oxygen mask
Shit, if I get any higher I'ma get the East and West beefin' again
Fly back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

[Interlude: Ken Kaniff]
Oh fuck. Oh shit. I got the hotel room ready. What time are you getting off... work? Or shall I say... what time are you coming home.

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A'ight, yo, yo, yo
One more time, yo
I'm only smilin' when I'm violent, got on a plane wylin'
Told the pilot to fly me to Tylenol Island (Now)
Stewardess like, ""You restless?"" ""Nah, bitch, I'm restful
Just hold this fuckin' jet still so I can eat these pretzels""
Forget school, the other kids are disrespectful
They hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles (Leave me alone)
I can't take it, I'm tryin' to gain weight, so I eat steak
Swallow the whole plate and weigh myself naked ([?])
Put out albums to teach kids family values
'Cause every mom and dad should allow you to pop Valiums
And never hit someone unless you got a reason
And if there ain't a reason, make one up, start swingin'"

Everybody’s Looking at Me

[verse 1: Eminem]
Lights, action, cameras flashing
Managers, sponsors, concerts, monster mashing
Flashing type who might throw his underwear in the trash like Marilyn Manson
Updated Axle Rose
White version of shaft pimp slappin' hoes
Pull up like a Mac, jet black limo
Strecth so far back you can't see the back windows
Stepping out pink hats, furs and minks
Chicks on each arm, what the fuck you think?
Right arm go that kid from N'Sync's chick on it
Left arm got that little pink chick on it
Me and Dre at the VMA's again
Pissin' off all these lesbians and gays again

[Verse 2: Proof]
Let me show you what the clip does
Cause D12 are harder than virgins inside strip clubs
Yo, we bust thugs
You beatin us is like 20 inch doves on glove buzz
It won't happen don't take the satisfaction
With funk flex you got your back spittin'
Actin' like you harder than life
Peace to Obie Trice
Rock a mic is on the right
Obie Trice has been around the globe twice
How it feel with the shine show was
Peace to Mark Labelle, Flex and Paul Rosenburg
Yo Em Diddy save me
Ayo, I think my dad's going crazy"

2004 Tim Westwood Freestyle

[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
I boss how I live
Fuck 'em hoe
God meant me
To push Bentleys
The Stat Quo
Still slammin' 'lac doors
This squad 'ill blow your brain out
Half-crazy
Bustin' out the window
Aight cut it, cook it, bag it
Distribute it through the city
Home get that cabbage
Take it, flip it
Turn illegal to legal
Launder, stay grindin'
Keepin' ya business on the under
Humble moves come up
Cops run up
But most of them corrupt
So what?
They want they cut
So pay 'em
All those who oppose the squad
Spray 'em
Got goons with MACs
Who kill for scratch
Okay I'm
One quick trip 'ill
And get you filled with gas
Broad day and niggas 'ill kill you
Without the mask
I'm getting bank
Like I'm shooting it from off the glass
Signed with Shady-Aftermath
Cause I'm after cash
Biatch

[Verse 2: Swift]
The way it go
Just heard my dog
Stat Quo flow
Ha, ya heard what he had to say
Use the words Swifty McVay
I'm ill enough to shoot a nigga through his pager
And if I missed
The shit's going exactly through his neighbor
My behavior's
Fatal enough to faint niggas
Old age and cradle
I shoot from unexpected angles
I changed ya facials
I could have you niggas hugging an angel
Literally
Niggas be crazy
I'm misery, breaking both of ya ankles
I diminish mentally
I turn you into a mimic of Kennedy
I don't go to sleep 'till I murder motherfuckers in trilogies
I recruit enemies
Friends ain't shit
They take yo ends and split
Willingly
What kind of shit got a nigga faking the funk
Dressed like George Clinton
But you hoes ain't making a buck
You out and about
With yo face frostbit
With a hustlin' mouth
But you really full of brussels sprouts
Husband or spouse
Your generation's running out
Because my gun's in ya mouth
Penetration coming (cumming) fast
We won, you lost
You got a witness program
Move out cold then John Walsh
Wild
And this the way we do
Emzy, Imma pass it to you
So what ya wanna do?

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
What I wanna do? What I wanna do?
Let me see right here, yo

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Not many people that I label would be able
To display table manners, but our plan is
To make this beat rock like scanners and make the fans just
Go bananas, yo, get our planners
That means our nuts for the sluts who don't under-
Stand this, yo, my plan is, yeah right
And y'all gon' stand there and act like you don't understand it
Like my name is Janet, my titty fell out and I ain't plan it
Yo, check this—check this out
And if you rocking with ya necklace out, that's my breakfast now
I'mma snatch it, yo, my style is wretched
You can't fetch it, no you can't stretch it
And yo, it doesn't really matter
Cause ya name I can't even pronunciate, you the—
Same type of mo'fucker to go and sucker
Punch Dre at the Vibe Awards, but he right behind the boards
The next day, so kiss an ass
Or kiss a dick, lick a dick, eat my ass
Whatever you won' do it's on you
Big Proof coming through with the mo—

[Verse 4: Proof]
Y'all niggas sing
Y'all done came to the Nina Ross war
Ya homie's a killa
But my killas they cost more
It's all inherited
I was boss born
Put eighteen in ya flesh
And make ya chest a golf course
Niggas know that we ain't even
You know why
(gasps) I'm still breathin'
Yeah I got that real heathen
With them steel beams on 'em
Through ya dreams on 'em
Like I'm still a fiend
Noted for mics
It's only right
You see my real team, brody
I do it live
I was sippin' on some cream soda
Heave phony
Fuck this back and forth
This ain't a tennis meet
I spray you industry gangstas
Cause they ain't in the streets
It's cool to beef
But why?
'Till you truce with or you trust me
I told you Puffy
And you can lose Big (B.I.G.)
I'm Proof
Who you could do big things with us
Spit dope
They call me Rick James bitch
Clip-clack
Bang-hit
Bang-drip
Drip fang of blood
Drip, drip, drank when sirens cop came
Body bag thick
Body bag, zip-zip
That's it
Fuck you bitch

[Stat Quo]
Down a dark street
It's the dirty Stat Quo
Lord have mercy
Breathe, hello I'm 'bout my cheese
The steez, mellow
Cash in the bank
On my grind in the paint
Oh, look how I do live with my boy Westwood
Up to no good
Smoking that good shit
See how I ball
Handle, handle my business
Eminem, Swift, P, Stat Quo that's it
Back on the track
Green Lantern done switched the beat
I'm guaranteed to my thang and drop the heat
My man Zeke is in the corner with him
Boss Hog, A-town, yes I be them
Do what I do freestyle, top of the dome
Don't fuck with my click
Leave Doc Dre alone
If I see you out the wars
Imma stab yo' ass
Whoop yo' ass
Ya fuck with me
I make ya handicap
And I pass the mic to my man Swifty
McVay he don't play

[Swift]
I'm Swifty McVay
Ya bastard out the blue
I'm hazard
I even haunt spirits that's after you
I'm cancerous with no answer
Pharmaceutic, I turn you allergic to being human
It ain't new
It's what I do when I'm feudin'
A sick nuisance
I have ya had
Until motherfuckers lookin' like Rick Rubin
What do you do to fools that think that they can take laughs?
Their face get sliced
And that's what's up
I inherit the power of all the rappers
I gotta be like Kruger
All them niggas bodies are coming out of me
I usually pack a Ruger
Now I see that I can be successful
By bruisin' yo chest
Without a thing
A professional
I'm a king that slaughtered kings
Exceptional, genetically raised by wolverines nigga
I give a fuck on what niggas seen
I'll send a fiend to pitifully raise you
And then convene bitch
That's what we do
Our crew D12
Rapping nigga
In take the Nina off the shelf
And I'm hazard for ya health
Like I said before
The type to walk the streets
And the five-o ignore
Me when they see me
Dog, I'll burn you like VD
And that's the way we be
Fuck you!

[Tim Westwood]
Easy, easy
I'm trying to hold a job down here
Yeah, yeah
I apologize if anyone's offended
You know tune out go to something else
Come back later
It's going down
It's real hip-hop
There's gonna be some swear words
Be prepared
Change the station if you ain't built

[Eminem]
Aftermath in the house now
Get yo' fricking mouth stabbed out
Y'all get so mad
Get so livid
Looking for dap from anyone who would give it
Now how you gon' value
Someone else's opinion
Cause you selfish
I'm rap's Elvis
Everybody try to grab the helm-ets and they hardhats
Run and duck for cover
Yo, fuck ya mother
What the fuck are ya?
Yo, I'm sprayin'
While I'm playin'
I ain't playin'
I'm sprayin' at your feet
Like hey Imma cock the hand
Imma pull my cock out
Outta my pajamas
And cock back the cock
Like it's chicken
Yo, check it out
The clock is ticking
It's countdown to Armageddon
And there's nothing you can do to stop it
Put your arm or head in
Or put a pen in it
But once the grenade pin is pulled
It's nothing you could do
But end up in the hospital
Yeah, yeah
Hospital, pital, 'spitals
End up in the 'spital
And y'all can eat my tender vittles
I don't really give a fudge
Fudge, fudge-packers
Is what y'all are
And y'all get smacked up
At the awards show
However you want it to go
We can make it go either way
Biatch
That's itch-bay backwards
F around and smack turds
They told us not to use no cuss words
So we gon' not use cuss words
And say busters instead
Have you all bleeding red
Damn, right out of yo' head
That's what I said
And my name ain't Fred
My name ain't special ed
And it ain't my birthday
But Proof can get on the mic in the worst way
And I don't even have to curse to say

[Proof]
Proof's a wolf
Grab ya pooper-scooper
Follow me
I fight to the death
Like Apollo Creed
I only hang with bitches that swallow seeds
Air Force Ones not Wallabees
Hollow tease
I be, rushin' colonies
I'm known by all blacks in hoods
Like collard greens
Last of a dyin' breed
Old school like Model Ts
When I ride on my rivalries
Like 2Pac writ
Put you in the I.C.U
With no eye sockets
More than five shots spit
So you can die hot bitch
It's only one topic
I need profit
Fuck the gossip
Harry the hype-writer
The night lighter
The only thing higher than Proof
Nigga is my lighter
I'm watchin' you fly niggas crash
Like Al-Qaeda
Crime fighter
Guess I rhyme by the mind tighter
Than the World Trade
Bit the jaws
Like Jay Dee
I put my fucking dick to broads
Broads, dog that's down on all fours
Of course I'm down to get yours
How come my niggas stop cold
When they heard capsule?
The rap flow is good
And they say that we fatsos
They gotta be this way
And we catch 'em with lassos
And how they feel about that?
Cause we breaking they cash flow
My niggas tell me right there
I ain't got no time
So know why fool
Dropped outta high school
Cause Slim said so
Now I'm back in this bitch
And I'm 'bout to ride this bitch
And this motherfucker rockin'
For Tim, asshole
I gotta do this shit right
Now Swift is on my left
So it's the way it is
Cause Shady in here
I'm 'bout to tell you niggas right now
Green is on the turntable
Why not do this shit daily, all year

[Stat Quo]
Hey doll, cheer
It's a grown man record
You don't want the pressure
This a grown man lecture
Sittin' on the dresser
Be a grown man bitch to her
Underneath my seat's a grown weather here
Peepin' my packer
He got grown man cheddar
Wheels, ransom notes, and checks
Are all grown letters
Hey doll, chill
Sit back relax, as I handle by biz
Green Lantern on the scratch

Handle my business home
Doing my thing
Home alone
But not Macaulay Culkin
Stat Quo be the champion
Icon winner
Eat niggas like dinner
Me and Westwood, handlin' our beeswax

Doc Dre did it long time ago
Like this and like that
And uh

Man uh
Pass it to Swifty Mc-V
And ain't no flick
To hear what my be sayin'

[Swift]
One-two, three to the four
Swifty with the four-four
Process of elimination is always complete
When I hit the streets
I wanna see who the biggest G
Hennessy don't do nothing but give you lumps
When you speakin' on us
Disrespect you be eatin' a bottle drunk
Turning you niggas all to monks
Red dots amongst ya foreheads
You get punctured once
Slump cowards with Ninas bitch
I mean it, how ya leanin'
Like the Tower of Pisa
Faces lookin' like pizzas
An animal instinct
I eat ya with cannibalistic procedures
Adam's apple some womens' fetuses
Me is just like special nature
I messed up, slurring my words off the liquor
And yes I hate to
See ya wack emcees
Step inside my face
And ya know my fo-fo (four-four) will clear the place
Ya runnin', I'm gunnin'
I'm stunnin' and it's fun when it happens
Especially when I'm rapping
I give dap to brothers I'm cool with
But yo know
You can't mess around with Swift
Ya just cool whip
Ya soft and ya sweeter than sugar
Dog, I'm just that type of nigga
That 'ill walk up on ya
Leave ya in a bed of blood
Huh, if ya tryna fuck with us
He said don't cuss
But I couldn't help it
I take my belt off whip ya wit'  it
Because I'm selfish
So I, just do the things I do
I freestyle for you
Then I pass it to my crew
Then they pass it back
And if ya wack
Then get slapped
For that type of

[Eminem]
Acid rap
Yeah and that's a fact
Slim Shady's back
Got eighty ladies layin' on they back
Yo, but I'm a mack
I'm a little nuts for Brittany
Little to sane for Whitney
Tell you the truth
Yo, Bobby would prolly get me
Catch me in the lobby
After he just hit me
After he sniffed three lines
He'd prolly knock out Fifty
He could prolly lift up both of us
And spin us both on both fingers like donuts
Yo, I party hard
But for real, I want Bobby Brown as my bodyguard
And that's for real
And that's the deal
Cause we got mass appeal
And I don't think that they can really take it
Cause I always let my nuts hang
Like I was doing push-ups naked
That's what I do
Is drink the Alizé and
Then I pass it to my man Proof and
Then we start goofin' around
And start spoofin'
Everybody, yo we in the party
And we could rock the party
And we could get it started
And if ya smell like (sniff)
Somebody farted
Or we can
We can do the Mardi Gardy
We could party harder
We could get started
What you wanna do
Proof, it's on you

[Proof]
It's on me
Might take it to the hip, homie

It's like Shady and Aftermath
We after cash
You want it
We gon' blast ya ass
(4x)

And listen, ya need to quit it dog
Cause Proof is low to the ground
Like midget balls
With them bridges falls
I lock ya ass up on the game
And I visit all
And it's like they signed
They said they did it all
Because they breeches small
But Imma tell you
In the likeness of the great 2Pac
I'm hot
And I'm fatter then Biggie Smalls
All y'all, need to recognize
Cause where I come from
It's still the East side
Over there by Dresden
Where we make their heads spin
Back then the back, ten
Make his ass backspin
This action of crack-skin
Nigga, I eat more Vicodin
Than the dots that's on the Pac-Man, board
Oh Lord
Give me my sword
On top of that
The freestyles I got you can't afford
But they free
Yo, they only cost attention
And did I mention
I'm a boss with henchmen
I send niggas to get ya
Yo, it's easy to do
How ya feel about this
Yo, the piece of the Proof
The piece of the clue
The pieces ya need
The pieces I got
On top of that my freestyle
Never stutter
My words are butter-rock
Like the niggas feel about us
I say precise
Nigga feel fucked up like D-Nice, did
For getting Scott La Rock slain
I rock 'caine and rock brains
Back in the day, when ya block came
Get ya block slain
Ya hood aborted
How I feel when they all get shortened
Haha
And I tell ya like this
Ya missing the ending
I lift ya whole hood
Like I'm fixing ya engine
Nigga, come on

[Stat Quo]
I keep my brim tilted
And tracked, I killed it
Atlanta, my city
I built it
Watch this
Young beast bob and weave
Young Stata (Status) make it hard to breathe
Please believe
I ball for cheese
Survival of the fittest
One of the trillest ever
Bow down, he severe
Finna lock the market
Marshall and Dre don' linked up
With the boy from the A
I am chillaxin'
Fine linen in my fashion
Bump yo' questions
Why you askin', anythang?
Niggas wanna know what I'm on
Riding on my enemies
Getting them gon' huh
A crime businesses
And you need homes
Something I can flip to increase my grip
Yo, why they on my dick?
Ride ya own lane
I gotta handle
Trust me lil' man
Ya need a little change
Here's for starters
I show ya how to come up
Work on martyr
Launder ya cheese
Do cash and beauty parlors
Hustle smarter
Green got me, haha
Green got me
Imma kill you Green

[Swift]
To me it's like second nature
I treat murders like a recreation
And these niggas steadily changing
They laughs like Mason
T.D. Jakes and all of these fake gangstas
They all be awaking
Because McVay can put a date on you homes
I'll engrave in ya tombstone
With urination
Now your whole funeral soon blown
Communication are for fools who be wasting time
Contemplating on making up
I ain't that guy
A grudge holder
I used to shove boulder in the counsel of my Aurora
Get caught and tell 'em it's yours
I can leave each one of ya body parts
Stranded in the middle of different forests
Having police ignore the shit
Niggas get hung like ornaments
While they hanging they trees
They get bombed like Vietnamese
In '46 or whatever year it was
I gotta buzz
And murdering you is all I love
This is Swifty McVay
I ain't by myself
I got Em, Proof, and Stat that be hot
And D12 is over, D12 is over here
And yo' death is near
And that's what's up

[Eminem]
That's what's up
Pass this cup
And then we blast you up
Freestyle right off the massive truck
We got truckloads
And uff, no
Cuff no and spin it backwards
And play it back later
Cause all y'all haters rockin' gators
Alligators, we see ya later
We ain't player haters
But yo check it out
We rockin' in our Navigators
And we can sit back
And we can stretch, we can check
Trek, I mean catch, anything
And we can fetch
I'm slurring a little bit
But during the part that I was doing
The urination, upon that girl and
Wait a minute, I ain't goin'
There with my rap
I ain't tryin' to be starting no crap
But yo, I be flowin'
With the stuff and I be knowin'
That when I start raking out them leaves
I be hoein'
And that's six in the mornin'
And we can do it
We can get it on until the crack of dawn and
We can get it on with Tim Westwood
We can do whatever you want
Bring ya best cause
We do what we want to do
On this microphone
Cause we ought to know
Or ought to inform you
That we get warm too warm
Sometimes we too hot to
Not to spit this ish
Spit it backwards and that said shit
Whoops, I didn't mean to curse
But yo Proof, come back
And lay one verse

[Proof]
I don't bite
But I spit the killin' venom
When I'm older
My pockets gon' blow up like Brazilian women
You can fight me here
Like some Big (B.I.G.) and Pac shit
Breaking laws off him dog
And hypnotic, he got it
Although he sound sober
I ain't gay nowhere near gay
I even hate a brown-noser
It's over, he killa
Got no skills
When these twenty-two spins
Ain't got nothing to do with Diablo wheels
Even the bible kills
I burn moral themes
Y'all pop like MTV
And talk more than Coral Jeanne
The poor foreseen that there is a God
I hope you guys slack
Cause when I lean back
Without the Terror Squad
I gotta two bigger
Then pistol move niggas whip
I leave fool ass lit
Like a cool cigarette
I'm 'bout the peace dude
In fact the peaceful
Since these niggas know my piece full
And since they watchin' Beef too
They watchin' niggas out here
They see how we go
Back in the day
With what, my people
The desert eagle
Leaving people living in deceased holes
How they feel about that?
My truck is all diesel
Freeze hoes
These people know it
G.L. in detail
They break like Lee nail
Crew is D12
More noise than a seashell
Cause we shall prevail
Without the Martin Luther King drill

[Eminem]
How you know the main side, so attraction
Psycho action
The man 'ill throw up on Michael Jackson
Sick enough to do anything
In any video
I could even pull out my whole titty yo
Wouldn't mean a damn thing
Wouldn't mean nothing
Like if you went and pulled hamstring
Cause you a fake 'iatch
I took the b off
Cause Imma be off with the switch
Just like you
Cause you walk with a switch too
That's what I meant
Cause I represent, every single day
Pass it off to Stat

[Stat Quo]
I'm so slum
I pull up in a double-quad deuce with no roof
On them big ass boots
White tee, no suit
Just me and my troop
Jam and be some hustlers
We are not a group
Grizzles, love me cause my smile is priceless
My advice, my life
I have them wetter than diapers
She want me to buy big jewels and wife her
Fuck the bitch tonight
But tomorrow won't like her
Go back to the club
And get a new one like her
And that's what I call completing a cypher
Wrassle with the bitches so they call me Roddy Piper
When a Stat come through
Your girlfriend get hyper

[Swift]
You be in the ocean with the worms and maggots
I'm what overdoses do for an addict
And after static with me
Holy ghosts will be given a homes
Automatically, it's either that or be rolled in a hole
I target ya dome
Watch that shit get blown
Like a head gasket
See I'm rabid
And known to foam acid
I accurately mastered battering bastards
I don't get charged for assault and battery
They be after me
Cause I smashed 'em
Happily answering
Any nigga that asks me would happen
I tell 'em the truth laughin'
That's just me
A five-star general
With aura that's horrible
I be smackin' ya captain
Turn a corpse into ya corporal
They won't know who did it
Tell your lieutenant
When an arsenal is set
For all of those threats of coming close
No you won't
With a Stephen King mentality
Ya don't believe me?
I can bring the casualty to ya family
And that's what's up
I got D12 in the house
Ya know what we about
Are you a man, a mouse?
And it seems like you a mouse
Running in that hole
Just cause you hoe
And everybody know
McVay yeah

[Proof]
See I'm going out
Blow 'em up
They wanna see me, what I'm all about
Pull 'em out
I'm in the club
Got the snub
'Bout to bust it out
Boy hear me, 'bout to hear me
'Bout to cuss a dog
I can't take it

[Eminem]
Can't cuss it dog
Take it dog
Ayo, get with the
With the girl
Better take it off
She got the bra better shake it y'all

Crackers And Cheese

[Intro]
""Other man!""

I stand in slapped by the wind as I begin
Do you know who I am? And many reply with a grin
Yes, I'm tired of being obtruded
Why should I be secluded? I've got a brand new horn to be tooted
To sum it up in a nutshell, ""Eminem will you kick it for me?""
So I find myself in a certain obligatory
A place that I dwell in, fell into some wonderful productions
To make up for lost time, and then it brings obstruction
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
A mental projectile, I aim at the reptile
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
""Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?""
Is there a reason for this? The hindrance is aggravating
How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?
Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead
There's so much more to learn and pages left to be read
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
While I hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor
Words can weigh a ton
Therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one

[Scratched samples] - ""Yeah"", ""It's another

Very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side
But I see no borderline, from under this colorblind
And some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
Wrong, the world would never endure to arguing
Awaking to the absence of unity is startling
""Oh foolish pride, what the hell are you trying to do?
You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to""
Your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless faceless
Damn, you're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverance of a starchild
Blessed with formidable talent and versatility
But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty
To infringe on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
Refusal of usin' is accepted now it's a trend

[Scratched samples] - ""Yeah"", ""It's another...""

[Eminem]

You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for
No. so then why do you speak for me
And every other white man when you that we're your enemy?

On the floor lies a broken door, cause I'm not to be spoken for
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
But ? is isolated, apologies are exhausted
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
Who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted
Switch to the opposite, now scenes are being re-enacted
Pull up that boy by his roots, destroy him quick
His fracture's obviating, we hate him, his patterns past us, huh
Always fighting for the position of top dog
That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
But I'm always having to prove myself, time after time
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast
Judged from the past and he's put last
And others with nothing to say
Stutterin' and slurrin' and mutterin' words with no meaning attack be signin' like Danny Kaye
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
And eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please
I've got a craving"

Take The World With Me

[Intro: Pacewon]
Some Outsidaz shit
I started hearing laughter in my head
Somebody laughing at me
Always laughing at me
I’m ‘bout to go crazy
So I started to set it on niggas, nah mean?
Pacewon!

[Bridge: Pacewon]
I’m high like Redman, tripping with a tab of acid
In my headband (‘Bout to lose my mind)
The name’s Pacewon, I’ll kick that ass quickly
When I die I’ma try to take the whole world with me (Me!)
Raw rhymes, penetrate the kidney
When I die I’ma try to take the whole world with me
(I got plans to lock it down) Take it with me
Take it with me, the whole world with me

[Verse 1: Pacewon]
Yeah, I be hitting you with rude shit
I be rolling like crews with new whips, call it stupid
But I mastered the fantastic ghetto bastard
Raw rap style to kick that ass with
Rough as Brillo, nympho spreading like info
More than the Jacksons got kinfolk
Your crew not strong, they stink like your mother feet
When she walk in shoes with no socks on
Light as popcorn, me! Disciplining fresh MCs
That you’d be scared to rock for

[Chorus: Pacewon]
(Who dat?) I’m low down and I’m shifty
When I die I’ma try to take the whole worth with me
(Me!) Most MCs get slapped ‘cause they sissy
When I die I’ma try to take the whole worth with me
Take the world, take it with me
Take it with me, set it!

[Interlude: Eminem]
Yeah! Eminem!
Dirty Dozen! Yeah!

[Verse 2: Eminem (Pacewon)]
I’m in the sound-proof booth without a roof
Drunk off 180-proof vodka with Dr. Ruth (What!)
We in the vocal room inhaling Magic Markers
Sitting in the dark lighting our blunts with sparklers
We got my man Pacewon behind the boards
Cause we tied the engineer up with output cords (Outsidaz, what!)
Bizarre’s in the lobby with the Beatles, smoking bowls
Poking holes in his veins with dirty needles
We get all doped up from popping uppers
And run a train on Foxy Brown without rubbers (Uh, uh-huh, yeah)
Smoking homegrown drugs, that’s why you can barely tell
What the fuck we’re saying, like Bone-Thugs (Uh!)
Hitting blunts ’til my lungs contort, smoke
Then take one more short toke before I snort coke (What!)
Shit, I been doing lines all day (What!)
My mind’s all clay from smelling Pine-Sol spray (What!)
What! No, hold up, hold up, hold up (Hold up!)
Smoking laced weed wrapped up in a fruit Roll-Up
My lungs are all swole-up and ‘bout to bust open
I’m just hoping I don’t die from snorting crushed Motrin

[Chorus 2: Eminem (Pacewon)]
I need drugs, somebody fix me
When I die, I’ma try to take the whole world with me (Me!)
Twelve blunts, plus I’m bringing your girl with me
When I die, I’ma try to take the whole world with me
I’m not coming back, so don’t send no one to get me
When I die, I’ma try to take the whole world with me (Gimme dat)
Fuck that, give me all my shit free
When I die, I’ma try to take the whole world with me

[Verse 3: Bizarre (Pacewon)]
Wack MCs, there’s a new sheriff in town
Put your guns down or die with a ill frown
The Outsidaz doing uppers and downers (Uh-huh, yeah)
Clowners, even masters scared to hang around us (Ugh!)
I’m a slob that don’t have a job (What!)
Peek through your windows, steal the good from your mom (Ma!)
We the starters, y’all niggas hit the benches
Smacking more hoes than Joe Jackson at feminine convention
Cop some mushrooms, I just can’t see
Pull me out the bathroom, I’m ‘bout to OD (D!)
Nasty, dirty, some say I’m filthy
Every time I drop the rap, Outs be like… (Ill, B!)
Brain’s too high, have no fear
Eat the pussy of a girl with burning gonorrhea
I made a box with a thugger on DD
Our crew’s more stupid on wax than Cowdy from Lion King
Who’s the big guy high off chocolate kai
If you disrespect me, you’ll lyrically die (Die!)

[Chorus 3: Bizarre (Pacewon)]
Somebody hide me, somebody get me
When I die, I take the whole world with me (Me!)
I’m ‘bout to do your girl named Cindy
When I die, I take the whole world with me (Lockin' it down!)
You bomb my set, I give her Good-N-Plenty
When I die, I take the whole world with me
You know my flow is so ill
MCs on the microphone and get verbally killed (Killed!)

[Outro: Pacewon]
All y’all niggas’ll get killed
Fucking with the Dirty D
Pacewon up in this motherfucker
All motherfuckers better act like they know
You MC, I don’t give a fuck where you from
Close to me or far from me
I’ma see your wack ass
Pacewon! Pacewon!"

1999

[Intro]
Hi kids, do you like Kim's bullshit? (No!)
Wanna see me stick her fucking eyeballs right in to my anus?

[Verse 1]
I got a fucking time traveling machine to go back all to this
And see all the piss that she gave me, bitch
She made me fall on my ass
The walls are caving in and I gotta go ham on this bitch
Like, woah, so we never fell in love so I didn't have to
Go through that shit no more
It's like a nugget, I'm hugging these sluts
That are bothering this fucking chick when I murder
And spit on the beat like the drugs I was taking
Just a bit of it
And stop slurping the blood off her face, or I'll murder you too with a bag full of mace and if Kim comes to my house and says ""Wanna get back together?""
And I say ""No, get out before I [slit your throat] and splatter the blood on this sweater!""
Blue eyes, red eyes, green eyes, bloody eyes
Hi Mom, you're back again, rock climbing my dick to see how famous my fucking life is?

[Chorus]
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rosie, pocket full of posie
Kim, Kim, be shady like me, I'm trying for the 4th
Stop being a bitch, please, walking across the highway
Playing Chicken, while brains splatter all over the road like
""ricken, ricken"", my phone's dead, now how can I call the bitch?
I'll use the payphone, this bitch is calling my dead phone, she won't leave me alone
Spent 75 cents on her, and she didn't answer
Now I'll come to her house and [slaughter her ancesters]
Boo! I'm a ghost, you happy to see me? I'm taking your soul
Well shit, you don't believe me? Boom, I did it, do you believe me now? Shit whatever, I'm the king so hand me the crown

[Chorus]
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady

1999, the slut's pussy is so dry, I said 1999, the slut's pussy is so dry, no other faggot can control my life"

Eminem Freestyle On The Farmclub

[Verse 1]
It's the mothafuckin' Farm Club
This little girl 'bout to get a arm rub
Who wanna see me on this mothafuckin' mixing board
Who wanna see me on a mothafuckin' diction lore
And I'll be kicking source to mothafuckin' camera looking right in it
I can kick twenty dope rhymes in one minute
And y'all don't understand cause my rhymes are Infinite

[Refrain]
What's the Farm Club?
It's the mothafuckin' *chika-chika* Farm Club
It's the mothafuckin' *chika-chika* Farm Club

Step Right Up

[Verse 1]
Step right up, I'm about to light up the skyline
So bright, I'mma fuck your whole night up
Light up your glow sticks and go stick a stick in your ass
This is the ghost of Christmas past
This is your host, you're supposed to kiss his ass
This is gross but listen close, if you don't
You can go stick your whole frickin' nose against his crack
'til he lets one go and blows your whiskers back
And get a great big old whiff cause if you last without passing out
You'll be on the next episode of Fear Factor, yeah, I'm back to, back to what?
I don't know, smack a little child actor's butt, Mike Jackson, what?
What the fuck you want? I got a blunt and some Jesus juice
Who needs an excuse these days
The way they rally around pedophiles, you lucky I don't pee in your face
I can do anything and apologize for it later as long
As it ain't a racist tape from '88, than I'm straight of that cannot be forgave
If I drank pee for, 18 years straight and ate shit every day
On a porcelain plate that was shaped like a toilet with a fork and steak, knife
For the rest of my life and had to watch my ex-wife get fucked by Vanilla Ice
Twice a day, cause I said N-I-G-G-A, when I was a teenager
Blaow-blaow, Shade uh 45, shorty, let me get your number, baby
Maybe I can hump your leg or something?
But it's time for me to go, so I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that boob, right?"

Power 92.3 Freestyle

[Verse: Eminem]
Come in spittin', with not writtin', non-fiction
Rappers try to step to this, with no prediction
It doesn't matter cause I'm smashin' and bashin' and crashin'
I hate rappers with a passion when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' kleenex, so I die like River Phoenix
When I'm chillin with Phoneix, with two Coronas
I'm on the microphone and I'm a own this
Yo, and I'm a bone this in Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable, I'm on two turn tables
With my man, but he doesn't matter cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only five foot four
Yo check it out I bust rhymes and get, groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter, he wasn't insulted
He said I'm 27 years old, yo, I'm an adult, kid
But, yo still, Slim Shady gets ill with the skill
And I'm a always bill and kill, my baby's mama
Just to piss the world off, just to piss the girls off
Yo I earl off
The top of the building, kill women and children
And then it hit me
Suddenly my wrists tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it, yo, ya'll can't conceive it
It's Slim Shady, I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out, and you can keep it, just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret
I'm top secret, like pop secret
Rappers they don't wanna see
Slim Shady, I'm from the motherfucking, D
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha
Yo, yo Slim Shady"

My Conscience

[Intro: Mark Avery]
Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old. Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store. But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart and suddenly his conscience comes into play

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Alright stop, now before you walk in the door
Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your mothafuckin' conscience!

[Eminem]
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money and run to one of your Aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

[Dr. Dre]
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns!

[Eminem]
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit, are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

[Dr. Dre]
Man don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!)
Not over this shit, drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
(You know what Dre, I don't like yo attitude)

[Hook]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I follow, I follow
I follow, I follow all these voices

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek
And smearing her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie, Kids?)
No but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail

[Hook]

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man (What the fuck?)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & (Eminem)]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathing
(Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheating
While you at work she's with some dude trying to get off
Fuck slitting her throat, cut this bitch's head off!)
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?)
Alright, Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

[Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
(What you say?) What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
(I'ma kill you, mothafucka!) Uhh-ahh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

[Dr. Dre]
Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aw fuck it, what am I saying?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?"

Public Service Announcement (2006)

[Spoken: Eminem]
Public Service Announcement, and another annoying message from Slim Shady:
Due to a massive amount of bootlegging, no thanks to this fucking guy, DJ Whoo Kid, and constant downloading, people are no longer buying CDs so that we can get paid for our fucking work. They are just continuing to get songs for free. Teenagers, older folks, and little fucking brats alike. See, what they do is buy computers, strictly pick songs that they like and burn them on CDs or put them on iPods, causing major decrease in sound scan, putting music retail in a tremendous slump, causing artists such as myself to make no money for record sales and be forced to tour, causing more stress, arguments with my wife, not being able to see my kids, drink more, take more pills, punch more people in the face, hate the world, and end up in rehab!
This has been a Public Service Announcement and an excuse to vent by Marshall Mathers. Not that I wouldn't have done the same thing if I could get music for free when I was a kid, but now that I rap for a living, buy my goddamn CDs! But in the meantime, buy this Obie Trice bootleg from DJ Whoo Kid and put more money in his pocket. Thanks!"

Hip Hop

[Intro]
C'mon!

[Verse]
I still remember the Hip Hop Shop days
All I ever wanted was to get props, not praise
A couple eyebrows s-s-s-shock-shockwaves
Through the underground, b-b-but not like this
This is when the shit g-g-g-got-got crazy
I was in the studio with the Doc-Doc Dre-zy
That's all I remember 'fore the shit got-got hazy
Then we made a song called ""M-m-my Name Is"" (Yeah)
And it skipped right over hip-hop, into hip-hop stations
Top 40 on radio, the kid got famous (Woo!)
He made it, but this was j-j-just not the way this
Was supposed to go, I'm afraid to say this, but–
*transition to ""It's Been Real""*"

Ghost Stories

[Intro]
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Yo, alright
Yo

[Verse]
I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleeping
I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
The Devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
I'm on the couch, bleeding to death in a haunted house
With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red slushes
Doors open and close by themselves, books fly off shelves
Curtains catch fire, the house melts
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple
Two cups of holy water and I'm looking at 'em half full
But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
It got silent, then all these voices said ""Come
Follow me into the gates of Hell""
I heard 'em yell, ""Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!""
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
I said, ""I need a room so I could try to get some rest""
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
And told me ""That's just for starters""
Satan'll be in to see me later to see if I'm interested in being partners"

Lift your shirt up and let me see them big breasts
We molest girls three times a day, three times a night

Jumping out when we ten deep
Beat you down and speed off in a Benz Jeep
Brothers be like: Eminem changed his style up!
Shut the hell up, I'm still seven miles slut!
It's '97 so get with it
Peep that back in the day stuff when that Infinite tape was hitting
Listen, must we forget
I originated all that rough shit, that talk drug shit
That left motherfuckers who said our sound like [?]
Detroit city is where I grew up bitch
Peace to all my Outsidaz in Jers
Forget what you heard, this is three and one third

If you got an STD and your penis falls on the floor (What the hell you gonna do?)
Pick it up! Pick it up! (Ahhh yeah yeah yeahhh pick it up, pick it up)
If you see a Slim Shady tape on the fucking rack
What does Dre do? (ooohhhh)
(On the uckin rack, on the uck without the f)

The Frim Shady is what I said because I'm freaking drunk
I pick it up, pick it up, I sound like a punk

Ayo they wish that they could ban me black
Yo, you standing back
Def methods, ayo got my hand in that
Who ever running it, ayo you get a jammed knee cap
Make the healthiest in your fam, handicap
You a fan of rap, my clan will tap your school, home, ya bitch house
Pull my nine millie, you gonna die with your fist out
Enemas is over with
Venomous is cobra spit
Aggressive dialect with aggressive sober pitch
My bionic phonics, demolish your logic, demonic can't stand the chronic impossible to hold on like vomit
Mics I palm it, cause they the bomb-it
Like terrorist is Islamic, I enter your atmosphere like a comet
The new god of rap, call me bigger Thor
Snap your back when I slap your ass in a figure four
From miles around they can feel us lethal
I make hardcore groups like Wu Tang sound like the village people (haha)
Be no sequel, of the energize, finish style, bust 'em down right now, the winner is... me
Then my man Mr. Paul we gonna star
Make your heart beat for your trying get down with us
We ball to the end, it's time to pretend
My friend to the left of me, the death of me
Me recipe to be with this don't even test MCees
Y'all can't get with us it's the dress, dress on ya"

Food Stamp (Phone Tap Freestyle)

[Intro]
Yo yo yo

[Verse]
My mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the newsstand (Here)
Two dudes ran up, jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with six or seven dudes screaming ""Get him!""
I grabbed one, lit him on fire, pinned and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept droppin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' in the middle of the kitchen

[Outro]
(Damn... damn... damn...)"

Cut Back

[Verse]
I cut back on the syllables just a little, but still I feel I should
Kill a few just to show that still I do put forth an effort
One foot forward, thank heavens, and, good Lord
Whoever would've thought that my umbilical cord
Would've been c-cut-cut from the s-s-same cloth?
There's no other name, just be thankful that I came forth
Temper the same, whether it's boiled or flame broiled
You say my name, you bet that ass you gon' pay for it
Just the respect is not the crown that I came for
But if you feel like passin' it around, well then, Jay, throw it
'Cause we all go straight toward it, if not I just wait for it
The other skateboard, got a couple of scrapes forget about it
I'm stuck in this rut, but I'll get up out it
I always do, I ain't gon' sit here and argue about it
I can't hop out of that gutter, I just crawl through up out it
I'm back, I'm sorry, I feel awful about it"

Murder Murder (Next Friday)

[Hook]
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)

[Verse 1]
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lamp in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin, clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin ""Freeze""
But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit be square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest

[Verse 2]
Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut your yackin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl in ""Set It Off"" did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin: ""Son, go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!""
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
And collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin ""TRUCE TRUCE""
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me! It was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

[Hook]
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)"

What's up with everybody beefin'
Everybody seem like they wanna beef
You know what I'm saying?
Everybody beefin' with everybody
This shit is crazy

[Verse 1: Dogmatic]
This is a bomb scare, fires on your hair
Terrorists live here, but I don't care
I'm making pot holes when I stomp, so don't stare
I stop to stomp competiton, with both fair
How dare, little soldier at ease
We shake down these streets, like Parkinson's Disease
We parking the road trees, plus load the weapons
Everything to six shooters, to high tech ones
If a green beans things, to my suggestion
Burn a big whole in your belly, like indigestion
With one question, who the fuck is Dogmatic
An underground nigga but this nigga's above average
It's serious! who can understand what I'm saying?
Yo Slim, tell them niggas (Eminem: We ain't playing!)
It's like you open a can of worms or smoked yams
I got bloody hands and burners that make you dance!

[Hook: Eminem]
This shit is serious! Do you really want beef
Do you really wanna end up, missing yo front teeth
And see yo family, getting smoked like a blunt leaf
And wrapped up in a zip-lock bag, like lunch meat
This shit is serious! Do you really want beef
Do you really wanna end up, missing yo front teeth
And see yo family, getting smoked like a blunt leaf
And wrapped up in a zip-lock bag, like lunch meat
This shit is serious!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
I'm the only one your bitch let touch her
Type a brother that'll, fuck yo mother, wit a fishnet rubber
I'mma misfit slash, nitwit
I love to put up biscuts, straight to a niggas lips, it'll fit
A biligerent and rowdy fellow
I'll dump yo body, and still fly away to Maui, on a teller
When it comes to beefin', it ain't no explain'
I'll change ya lauguage, wit a stainless
I'll contain, wit a name which to make you famous
I'mma deranged pit, I'll bend you till ya back touch ya anus
Don't ever take me to court, I'll whack the plantiff
Then beat the fuck out the baliff
A heinous, miscellaneous, nigga never miss, when the AK lift
I paint ya face wit, any weapon, just like ""The Matrix""
They ain't steppin', don't even say shit
You heard about the bodies in my basement, you joinin' them, face it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Proof]
Laugh indictive, like Kim lipstick, and get a nose bleed
My blow speed, is like my hands working ten stick shifts
Captain ask, to stick my finger in the barrel of a Mac 10
And snatching the driver out the black Benz
Smashing his contact lens, my life start when his contract ends
""Go kiss-and-tell, and contact Kim!""
Let's be factually, actually, y'all ain't after me
Got (???) wit +Regis+, y'all beef is without the +Kathy Lee+
Told y'all my battlery, and go to war happily
How you gon' call my bluff, when you scared to send a fax to me
My factulty guns drawn, one wrong move dudey
And it's too heads on ya body, into a gangster movie
For lot being real, scared to pop wit the steel
It got skeletons in my house, every closet is filled
Now how does it feel, with this Baretta to ya dome
And to know that ya mom's know, that you was never coming home

MC Hammer vs. Vanilla Ice

[Intro: Eminem]

1, 2, 6, 8, 10...

[Verse 1: Eminem in the style of Vanilla Ice but rapping as himself]

YO! I'm Back, to bust another fresh track
You say, that I have the ability to fly
Fly right pass ya ass, when I blast
Ya everytime I grab the mic, I crash a-
Nother rhyme it's a crash landin'
Everytime I grab the mic, I'm kinda outstandin'
Cuz no-one can step to, a single a rhyme
And I say "" Yo, what kept you?
Holmes, you going too slow
You're too slow for the flow "" and I know
That Eminem is returning
To bust the rhyme and suckers are learning
That when I kinda go offbeat a little bit
I step back to the rhyme and say
That I bust a rhyme all day
Make a sucka say ""Hey!
I cannot step to you Eminem
Cuz you are so bad, Damn
You're the baddest motherfucker in the whole damn land""
And you're right, cuz I am
And I don't go offbeat, not once
Cuz I grab the mic and bust for months
And I don't give nobody another turn
Cuz everytime I grab the mic, I don't let a brother burn
Because he can't step to a single rhyme that I do
Cuz you knew you're through

[Verse 2: Proof (rapping as MC Hammer)]

Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Now I grab the microphone, you know I am imperial
Is a production that rocking your stereo
Don't front with me, cuz I am the boy
I get on the microphone and I destroy
Now you can take a body, that's not from Oakland
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer keeps on choking, yeah
I can do it right and nobody will know
For I am the Hammer and I'm running the show
They come from West Indies south of California
I wake you motherfuckers up, early in the morning, yo front!

[Interlude: Eminem (hereafter rapping as Vanilla Ice)]

Yo Hammer, that was pretty good man
I don't think I can step to you man, I don't know
(Proof:  ... I'm great!)
I'll just try but it seems like you outdo me, no matter what I do
(Proof shouts something unintelligible)
Here I go anyway

[Verse 3: Eminem]

Here I am, back to attack the whole damn land
You know that Vanilla Ice is hype
I grab this mic and I rhyme all night
MC Hammer cannot step to me
Because I got the rhymes and I'm truly
So damn hype and the place to be
I'm rhyming on the mic on the M-I-C
M-I-C is the abbreviation
I grab the mic and rock the whole nation
You know that Vanilla Ice, is so precise and I get so nice
Get so nice, I start developing manners
And I whoop your brain like ""Scanners""
Because Vanilla Ice is bad
Now what you got to say about that dad?

[Interlude: Proof]

You can't step to me boy
I sell more records!
Yo. I know here I go.  Yo Manny gimme something yeah!

[Verse 4: Proof]

Now everytime I go, you know I like to start
My name is MC Hammer
I rule hip hop charts
Seven million seven million seven million sold
And your shit barely even touch gold!
Now everywhere I go, they know that I'm a star
I'm the  H -A-M,  the M -E -R
Cuz every time I rock it they know I rock the mic
I am MC Hammer
And you know what I am like, ROAR!

[Interlude]

Eminem:  I don't know man, I think you got me, man. I don't know. I'mma try.  Check this out.  Fallin'...
(Music speeds up)
Proof:  Ain't no one here you sucka!
(Music returns to normal)

[Verse 5: Eminem]

Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in the car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I try to get away 'cause the jackers jack
So I step to the rhyme and I just say I'm
Gonna bust a rhyme for the whole damn mind
Then you say that I cannot bust a rhyme
But you gonna get got MC Hammer
Because you know you get on the mic
And drop poor grammar
And you can't slam a jam because I know that I am the man
And all the teenagers they like ME
You know why? It's a scheme agents
Have developed to sell me
Because I bust a rhyme so cleverly
And you know that I got knowledge
Cuz I'm in show biz
And I bust a rhyme all the time
So MC Hammer you cannot step to
A single rhyme that I do cuz I knew
That you are through, you are washed up
Oh, so step to the back room
And I told you that I have to scold you
Because I am Vanilla Ice
I grab this mic and I get so precise
And you cannot step
So why don't you get swept?

[Interlude: Proof]

Now you makin' me mad boy
Now I'm gonna get your ass
Now you gonna know who's on this motherfuckin' mic! Yo!

[Verse 6: Proof]

It's about time that I turned out your lights
Now I see the Vanilla Ice tryin' a chill in my freezer
You just don't know that your mama is a geezer
She say Hammer, yo Hammer, yo Hammer Hammer Hammer
But she jump on me because I'm a bad mamma jamma
I did your bitch, Hammer don't play
I got the funky shit and it goes this way
I wish your whole ass try to step, you can't touch this
You fuck with the Hammer you'll be walking on crutches
Yeah that's what I'm sayin', I ain't playin'
I'm Hammer, I'm Hammer, yes it's the Hammer Man
My lips may be big but I can rap better
Than looking at your ass, you look like a piece of cheddar!
Yo though you steppin' to me, you know it's no dream
I dig Vanilla Ice and turn his ass into whipped cream
So you know who's the best by far
It's the muthafuckin' HammeR with a capital R, roar!

[Interlude]

Eminem: Now you made me mad.  And you know what happens when you make Vanilla Ice mad Hammer?
Proof:  What?
Eminem:  I don't like it.  So yo! (Pauses)
Proof: You scared boy?
Eminem: I ain't scared of you, Hammer. I'm just thinking. I gotta think of something clever
Eminem whispers: Ice Ice baby, too cold too cold

[Verse 7: Eminem]

When I'm through with you
You'll be goin' to heaven
Cuz I smash the glasses and fuck 3-5-7
24/7 they was bangin' my cock
I said ""yo fuck Hammer
Get a piece of the rock, yeah""
I said yeah. My name is Vanilla Ice, you can't
Step to me, you thought that you was a champ
But I stepped on your ass like a piece of carpet
And rented you for sale like an upstairs apartment
Yo, that's my clever metaphor
And every time I grab the mic you know
Kids like me cuz I'm better for
Their ears, because their mothers and parents
Like to hear the way I rhyme and I make an appearance
And say hey, I got a blond streak
And that's why people like me cuz I'm hard as concrete
I'm always on beat when I do this show
You know that Vanilla Ice has to go cuz I'm so damn fresh!

[Verse 8: Proof]

Now you steppin' to me punk
There is no maybes
You steppin' to me wrong and I'm gonna ICE ya baby!
So you say what's the matter, why Hammer loves to rap
Cuz all that shit you talkin' to Hammer is bullcrap
Now I know a rhyme every day I'm ready
I'm down with Dougie Fresh, Van-L is not ready
Now everywhere I go, on MTV Rap
They know I'm the best cuz now I don't take no crap
Now Vanilla Vanilla he's beaming out Hammer
They say yo Hammer don't put me on the slammer
I said yo sucka, stupid muthafucka
You messin with me but I'm no sucka
I already pumped it up, and already got it started
So steppin to me white muthafucka you'll feel broken-hearted
So I'm gonna pass the mic and you know about me
Hammer get off the fuckin' mic!!! I'm outie!

You blew me out, man, you beat me"

It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin' an acappella that'll chop a fella
To mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showin'
Developin' anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya
Eatin' a full course meal watchin' you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feedin' you liquid darvocet
Pumpin' you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receivin' with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of livin'
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storin' the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream, ""I'm still alive!""
Drivin' a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pullin' your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crowbar to pry her apart with

You can hate me now
But I won't stop now
But I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now
(Proof: Don't hate us)
Bop me and degrade me now
I'm blowing up now

I'm so drunk now I'm throwin' up now
(Proof: Throwin' up now)
You can hate me now
(Proof: You can hate us now)
You can deflate me now

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Hand me an 8
Beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Ma$e
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white person trapped in a room with Lauryn Hill
Human horror film but with a lot funnier plot
And people will feel me cause I'ma still be the Madd Rapper
Whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, making fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in the Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back striking at Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for
Everybody's pissing me off
Even the 'No Limit' tank looks like a middle finger sideways
Flipping me off
No ""duh"" I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you
Then jump in the grave then bury myself

[Interlude]

Eminem: You can hate me now
Proof: Hate us!  Ha! Ha! Ya!

[Verse 2: Proof]
Need to run for cover
Eminem is white but he's still my brother
Slim Shady, known to go and smoke crack
But you and Charli Baltimore got something in common
You both wack, how you feel about that?
No need to jock 'em
You so wack you make Master P sound like Rakim
When it's time to bust y'all when we trust y'all
We dust y'all, who y'all I break your balls like cue balls
I know who you are, you RuPaul, do stall
For those that try to fall and try to brawl
All y'all get bust up and banged up, framed up
How many MC bring my name up, the same slut
Said the same thing as freestyle, don't need to rehearse
My verse is universal, curse a flow
Crush you like Hershel Walker, Allie Sparker
Three day sparker highland Parker chalker
You MCs can't get darker than the Midwest bracket
It's us, me and Emzee, come right there, we feeling flimsy
Tipsed up, one time lifetime we ripped up
It's bad to the evil , met that, now it's all to say
Death rap, fuck hoes, don't even say get blast away, passed away
Blasted ass, hey yo, they say we're Aftermath
Slim Shady, you heard that, my words black
But bust you up because you preferred that
To hear me now, preferred that, the surgical snipe
Preserved you with life, I'll make you allergic to life
You die for this, don't even battle us
See us. At the. With that. Subterreanean
We knock your brain in

Have a spot reserved in a handicapped parking section
How the hell can you leave when your trainless?
Your smooth sailing hit a storm and looks likes your failing
Left a band stranded empty handed
Put so much as a toe in my way and get branded

My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish kabab
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
(“I hate white people”)
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
No, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
‘Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (Um, one, two)

Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry
""But Eminem, this is your record release party!""
I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford

Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (Brrrt)

See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain
You'll be taking it slow, feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ha ha
Treat women like property, possessive like a noun with an apostrophe S's, I'd probably stalk broccoli, yes it's
Socrates with a block of cheese and a dollar stuck in this soda pop machine
Got emcees dropping to knees, copping a plea bargain they keep sobbing, like, ""please stop it""
Aftermath, bitch, still Detoxing
Looking for us? We over here like we're eavesdropping
Apparently still mad over what I said last year
On that Vegas track, I just look stupid and stand there
And try to act like I can't hear
What? Sorry dear, but I think Pam Grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear
Just then Foxy Brown, walks up and knocks me down
Kicks me and socks me, ow

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain

[Verse 2: Karacter]
I'm not scared, I'm just a white kid in a black neighborhood
Side terror
Wipe off this fear, to not thinking clear
I need to get my head straight
I do feel like a Nazi in a Jewish camp
Concentration
A foolish act to puzzle you fools with the coolest raps like Rubik's cube that I stole just to solve then give it back
Stupid face your making bitch
Loose the mask
Oh wait
I'm sorry that's my bad
Looks like shit
Might be obvious and a waste of my time to say you look like the crap from a sewage plant
But as you were saying
Back to your rant
Lex Luther just got circles ran round his puny ass so fast his neck snapped and it dropped his pants
You've just been schooled by Clark Kent
Shopping at the market
In the parking lot next to your apartment and part from it
You tried to look hard as shit but you pooed your pants
And I didn't even get to use superman yet
And he's my strong suit
Fall soon back on, to attack these villains, and kill em just passing em back and forth, feeling em then put an axe in their nads
That's what I call a hacky sack bitch
Cut cut and pass
You think your lucky
It's Chucky the mother fucking assassin
Castrating stuck in the cabinet sucking a bottle of Aspirin
Preparing a statement while he sharpens his blade
Carves it across his face as he coughs
Testing his voice is it raspy
Nope, just naturally nasty
Get ready for the ass whooping he's bout to serve up like a double cheese burger from Arby's

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain

[Verse 3: Karacter]
Dearest resident
Don't flip past this channel and skip it
A paramedic is in your living room slitting scissors through your flannel get up
So get up, feel better, and add up what I said on that chalk board of yours boarded up inside your head
You're almost dead
I'm your guardian
Here we are
Reminiscing this shit as we walk down the hall of wits
Shelve these thoughts
Highlight reel of selfish tall feminist broads
Everyone that's screwed you over when they said they'd call
Seminar, phantom here I am sent to ward these demons off

[Eminem]
Off misogyny
Sodomy, how many chocolaty jell-o pops can he possibly lace, walking atrocity
No wonder you scoff at me, it’s still obvious I invented prick

[Karacter]
Rest in heaven, I'm evidently milking this game like
Her breasts are dripping
Guess I'm busy, but unless you bitches are seven teen and eleven months I don't want to hear the pessimism
Tell the rest I'm on readers digest while I'm on the toilet
Pizza sky rocket
Gossip isn't
Close to the shit
I must be fast, lickity split
There's no exaggeration, I mean it Brittany
A fan of Trina
Get's me like I wanna jam my weener in Christina

[Eminem]
And Serena and Selena
Scarlett Johansson, Tiffani Amber Thiessen
Give me a damn good reason to not wanna slip an Ambien in a Cappuccino
And try to have a threesome with Janet Reno

[Karacter]
Stuff her with cream like a spicy popper of jalapeno
Appetizer, my main meal's Destiny
Now, If I die I'll come back to haunt your back side grizzly
Capitalize the ""Ass"" in fucking Caspar and Wendy
As Detroit looking like a power outage, just a black out city
Crack house just down the street of McDonalds, where you lost your virginity
Oh dity, I'm out
Explosive, you're left with the call
You might want to

[Eminem]
Head for the fire exits, I'm coming through like a wrecking-ball

[Karacter]
Test us, we're scared of nothing at all

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I won’t ease your strain
You'll be taking it slow, feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace"

Mic Check One Two

[Intro]
Let's just go, man
Is it recording?
Yeah, let's just rhyme out our ass
Bout to kick a rhyme right outta my head
Mic check one two
Mic check one two
Mic check one two

[Verse 1]
Here I go in the place to be, rhyming like this on the M-I-C
Here's the way that I rhyme so naturally, and actually
When I grab the mic, all the people say ""M&M, you're one of the funkiest MC's out today
And I say ""I agree"", because I am a funky dope slamming MC
I slam them back, daddy, eveytime I grab the mic and say I wanna rap, daddy
But you can't, because I take it
Grab the mic and after I'm done, I break it
When I'm done, I just slam the
Microphone and cram it right in your asshole
Because 'asshole' and 'cram the' didn't rhyme, but that's alright 'cause I'm jamming
On the microphone 'cause I'm slamming, busting out lyrics and you like to examine
My style that I'm doing, but if you step to me pursuing, I'll ruin
All your hopes and dreams, 'cause I work with my man, he's on my team
My man Manix is on my side every time the (?) they say
""Damn, how'd you make a beat like that ma'am?""
And I say ""I'm not a ma'am, I'm a sir"", and if you step to me your eyes'll be blurred

[Bridge]
One two
One two mic check-a one two
One two one two
Mic check-a check one two
Mic check-a one two one two
Mic check three four six seven eight

[Verse 2]
Mic check one two
Do unto others as you would have them do to you
No, that's not the way I work because
When I rhyme I'm a jerk
I grab the mic and start dissing
All these MC's and try to put them into submission
Take them out for the count because the amount I throw is so deaf
Word! Deaf didn't rhyme but I
On your windshield just like a turd
Every time that I rhyme you know that I'm
Going to climb to the tip tip top and I'm
Not going to stop 'cause I grab the mic and dop-da dop dop
I fucked up, but that's alright because my luck's up
No it's not, 'cause here I am, I got a lot to give
And I don't live positive
Now I'm not saying I'm negative
But if I grab the mic I do mega kits
Every time that I grab the mic you know that M&M is gonna be rolling his tongue just like this
And then I go do a funky rhyme and if any MC steps up he gets fucking dissed
Bad, don't call me dad
Vanilla Ice said that, that made me mad
So when I step to the mic
Know that I gotta clear my throat and excite
I'm trying to get the mic cord away from the stereo so I can bust some material
I take it around my leg, and then all the MC's wanna beg
And say ""Yo, please give me a turn!""
I say ""No"" because it's my turn to burn
And I bust a rhyme like this and you can't step to a rhyme that I do 'cause you're dissed!
You're dissed so bad every time
Sure, he don't get a turn, and he's starting to get mad but I'm
Just going to take the mic, I'm not gonna give it to him because I am
So damn hyped in the place to be
Rhyming like this 'cause I'm an MC
Rhyming so deaf to the happy ass beat
It's kinda gay like Liberace but hey
Listen to the words that I display every time I kick a rhyme this way
You know that the star is worthwhile, every time I grab the mic I'm longer than I mile

[Verse 3]
I waste no time, when I can't flip I caper
I cut your butt up like G Floyd like paper
When I bust a rhyme I'm a stud
That's what I like to say, jump on my pud
Girly girly, would you like to fuck me fuck me in my house early?
Or late, I don't care, let's make a date 'cause I don't pump weights to get dates
Just because I'm huge, I bust a lyric
But I get greedy like a Scrooge
When I grab the mic it's kinda stingy
I kick rhymes that ain't dingy
When I bust I'm like forcillin
You try to grab the mic and force it again
But you can't 'cause you are speechless
And I get sandy like teachers
I get sandy, I grab the mic handy
It's so I can get candy
When I bust the shit I get like a noogie
Then I boogie, boogie on down because
Every time that I kick a rhyme I just 'dud'
I meant to say 'do', but I got an addiction to friction every time I kick non-fiction
Non-fiction science, every time I grab the mic I got the alliance
Right behind me stepping into the 90's, you know you'll try me and you'll die, G
So don't even try it, I don't buy it, so you'd better keep quiet
'Cause you're into it, ain't nothing but to do it

[Verse 4]
You'd better catch up 'cause you're trailing
You'd better put springs in your ass and jump like Van Halen
Every (time I bust a) rhyme I get like a panther if you're lying that slander
'Cause you're lying like Berry Saunders, every time I grab the mic I get married and I
Like to kick a rhyme that I pick
Every time I pick the mic up I stick
A dick right up your ass like a faggot
You're gonna die, be crawling with maggots
Every time I dread you like hair, I said you'd better get (?) on your underwear
You'd better run, 'cause if you don't
Afraid you'll be seeing a ghost like a Rake
You ain't an eighth of me, every time I grab the mic girls try to act so faithfully
But I say ""No, don't be a fan. Just try to step to my dick and act like a man""
No, that don't make no sense but every time  I cut class like a pair of scissors I get so damn hyped
On the mic, 'cause every time I step to the forefront I like
To wonder on to something that I'm drawn to
Every time I grab the mic and pass it to Sean he
Gets so deaf but I'm not gonna pass it yet
'Cause I burn like acid vet, word!
I'm a stick like a trident 'cause you need guidance"

Open Mic Feb. 17, 1996

[Kuniva]
Check my vocals, 'cause you know what I'm about
It's best to play like O.J. Simpson and I just stab out
Why did you enter? You didn't comprehend
See this is a battle for MCs who think they might win
But fuck the battle, let's take it to the streets
'Cause you a pussy, oh well, if you are what you eat
Now you can go get your crew ? you now
? me wrong ? and all this shit gon be blew out
Claiming you jumped out bitch
Nigga we bust in the bitch, you talk more shit than Reggie Miller
Never spent nothing more, nothing less
The first single that you drop is ""I wanna be fresh""

[Eminem]
Any rapper sayin' those kind of rhymes
In this day and age, in this period of time
Trying to battle Eminem is worse than David Starr
Trying to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Flat and Bizarre
? that's why you beg to differ me
You ain't got no style plus you lack delivery
Not to brag, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
You're that bitch, you couldn't slip up in the zone
If I put banana peels around this fucking microphone
So get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top
And take this building down 'cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop"

Verse 1

[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, alright, alright
Uh, Slim Shady, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
It's only fair to warn I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4-door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar, with your skeleton showing
Developin' anorexia, while I'm standin' next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than 20-percent chance of livin'
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy on you while you scream ""I'm still alive!""
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson to set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick so tight you need a crowbar to pry her apart with

[Outro]
Motherfucker! Slim Shady, bitch!
Recognize, for the '99! Album February 23rd!

Cancerous (Freestyle)

[Verse]
I'm cancerous
So when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your freakin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
‘Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get laid
More than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her freakin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
‘Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the hell can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?"
"[Title]
Verse 3

[Intro]
Its like this and like that and like this (x2)

[Verse 1]
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
Patrolling corners, looking for hookers
To punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr. and smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now"

DJ Fashion Freestyle

[Verse]
Come here spittin' with non written, non-fiction
Rappers try to step to this with no prediction
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm smashin' and bashin' and crashin'
I hate rappers with a passion when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' Kleenex
Or I die like River Phoenix when I'm chilling with Phoenix
With two Coronas, I'm on the microphone
And I'ma own this, yo, and I'ma bone this in Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable, I'm on two turntables
With my man, but he doesn't matter 'cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only five foot four
Yo, check it out, I bust rhymes and get groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter, he wasn't insulted
He said ""I'm 27 years old,o, I'm an adult kid.""
But yo, still Slim Shady gets ill
With the skill and I'ma always build and kill
My baby's mama just to piss the world off
Just to piss the girl's off, yo, I hurl off
The top of the building, kill women and children
And then it hit me, suddenly my wrist tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it, yo, y'all couldn't conceive it
It's Slim Shady, I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out and you can keep it, just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret, I'm top secret
Like Pop Secret, rappers, they don't wanna see
Slim Shady, I'm from the motherfuckin' D"

I Get Money

[Intro: Audio Two (Eminem)]
I get money, I, I get money, I
I get, I get, I get, I get (Ha-ha!)

[Hook: Audio Two (Eminem)]
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah!)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah!)
I, I get money, money I got (I get it!)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run this rap shit!)
I, I get money, money I got (Now, guess who's back?)
I, I get money, money I got (You thought I left you!)
I, I get money, money I got (Now, why would I do that?)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (1, 2, 3! Ha!)

[Verse: Eminem]
They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's 'cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long?
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson of rhymes
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn, I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of St. Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun 'cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned?
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20's still?
And Fif' hit a lick on that Coca-Cola shit
He ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score!
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office, man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
'Til I hear the word ""has-been"", that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!"

Male Prostitute

[Vocal Intro: Eminem]
Yo, Manix man, I think I just spotted my prey
There she is; check her out
Yea I know she's with her man and everything but...
I can still get her man, 'cause you know me
Just drop a couple of smooth rhymes on her
And I got her you know what I'm saying?
Aight, I'll tell you what I'mma do about her man!
Aight, Check this out...

[Verse]
Hey baby, let me have a word with your man
(comic-like slap sound) - now lemme show ya exactly where I stand
I'd like you to enter my fortress
Just cause you are just the most gorgeous
Woman I've ever seen and for just
The next few hours of ya life I'd like to
Bring out the real woman inside you despite you
Might be in love and all that with your, man
But lemme get chat with you
Why don't we get to know each other, haven't you
Ever wondered what it was like to date an M.C.?
Now what's a woman like you, without a man like me?
And someone like yourself I can grow very fond of
Beyond a doubt and I would always hold onto your
Love, and be faithful I promise
Cause I'm as
Loyal as a puppy, and I'd treat you like a goddess
That we would've stumble onto each other but first, wait
Before you're lured, I want to know if you're insured
And if you're sure, you're gonna be able to endure
A tremendous amount of pain that seems endless
Strenuous brawn and brain, but yet when this
Whole thing is over and I make it through the ride
Then I'd gladly stand by your side"

Verse 2

[Verse 1]
Met a retarded kid named Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the forty
Mixed it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I strapped the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited until it absorbed in, and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers, we blowin' up your house, killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strappin' more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
Motherfucker!"

The Half-Time Show Freestyle

[Verse 1: Eminem]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstanding
Any man planning to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standing
I'm headed for hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
""Bill Clinton, hit this and you better inhale""
Cause any emcee that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy, pushing a ten-speed
Screaming at Aunt Peg
With three spokes sticking out of my pant leg
Eff a headache, give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
And you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack
You act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwing you back up 'em
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em
The rap struck 'em harder than getting hit by a Mack truck
And then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper that trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'm a climb the Empire State Building
Get to the last step and still have half left

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9""]
Pompous, roll with monsters and dons for accomplices
Cock non-fiction concepts constant
Bomb threat and I ain't even on yet
On spec, I spit thunder and you ain't even seen the storm yet
Lightning in the clouds, start a fight in the crowd
Hyper and loud, get this mic in your bowels, biting my style
Attack all of y'all, react on the thought of y'all
Slaughter y'all, I'm calling y'all, in fact, I'm blackballing y'all
More official than an ordered pistol aimed toward rappers
Blame fame for it, shrapnel bits tore the tissue
Burying the [?] under the gravel
Saw off the pump handle and barrel for carrying convenience
My odyssey carries the [?], compare me to Phoenix
Solid and hard and light up a star, I got to be Venus
Huddle and bomb back, take cover and all that
And try to not die, you not rugged enough
You just shook as soon as I step foot in this rap game
I'm a bubble on contact like peroxide, I'm touching a cut
You stuck in my raps, [?]
Y'all sucking my ass, boosting my confidence a buck and a half
I know the game, I'm a train trapped inside a name
And whoever they taught me, yo, we ride the same
I shoot crews with the truth and chew lies of change
Speeding on a dragon in an attempt to collide with fame

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This 9 is lifting you six feet when I spray rounds
Hit you with six shots in mid-air and four more on the way down
As eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now)
No pun intended, just hop out of this whip
And leave it unattended 'fore I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes in one minute
Cause I can leave your Infinit' full of those even if someone's in it
Snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it
Corner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged
Bitches get slapped and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cavewomen while I'm gravedigging with Marilyn Mans'

[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9""]
You get laced by the gun in case you try to run
Hatred on my face by the ton, get baked by the sun
Constructed of interplanetary rock and metal
Topping levels of combustion that's hot enough to stop the devil
Innovative thrust that a enemy
The impact'll be the generated destructive energy to flatten trees
Black boy since birth, burst and tore the womb up
To hit the earth like a asteroid and blow the moon up
Trust me, I'm the epitome, you better bust me
Anybody can say, ""Eff [me]"", and he gon' touch me
Smoking organic ganja inside of a stanza
Me and my man cypher with cans of volcanic lava
Man, and it's hot, I'm out of my head
From the bottom
I can leap out a bottomless pit and land at the top
Raw, that's what I came out here for
To raise an eclipse and occasional trips to the beer store
Switch up the breed of emcee and stick a chick up
Vigorous speed to reach in the sea and pick a fish up
I'm fly against all laws of gravitation
I done crushed all ya'll, now you want a collaboration
But eff that, you stepped up, so I'm a eff your rep up
And tear the rest up with every joint that I press up
So stop violence or violence'll stop you
Got crews iller than anybody on your block do
I roll with a white boy that pop 'shrooms
Listen to rock tunes and jump in a costume and rob you

[Verse 5: Eminem]
What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
""Hi, Renée, I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?""
Blood dripping from it
Ripping your stomach up from the waist up
You talk a lot of ish, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Waging wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
Demon is here, I'm steaming this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick, trick, it's an image, I live it
Give a what? I don't know what a ""what"" is to give it

[Verse 6: Royce da 5'9""]
I grab your throat and squeeze it until it's swollen
Then exceed it until it explodes over your shoulders
Pick up your urn with ashes in it and piss in it
Diss intended to verge like a hearse with a witch in it
No more do I battle emcees for fun
Now it's guns and niggas should run from the [?]
It's barely vivid you witness rare exhibits of terrorism
Through Israel and the art when even they're dark and dismal
I'm a deranged breed, shoot me
I'll catch a bullet in my teeth
And spit it right back at you at the same speed
I'll injure if I'm offending you, we can go to blows
Even my interview should be a Hip-Hop Quotable
You can have the title, that's for brothers that's cocky
I'll take the belt with diamonds in it like Ted DiBiase
I'm rebelling your chains, in fact, you wack
I'm telling you the plane still spelling your name in your raps
You're soft-hearted, I'll say, ""Let's take it to the streets""
You'll start pleading with me before we can get the walk started
I'm a deranged breed, so don't try to touch this
5'9"", I told you I don't know the chorus

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause
And by the time you all catch on, I'm a end your career
And walk away with the floor, so you have nothing to fall back on
I'll throw you out of ten floors
Pull a freaking headache out of my head and put it in yours
I'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This trick wanted to blow me, I said, ""It ought to happen""
""You swallow nut, girl?"" ""No, but I brought a napkin""
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing
Cause I sent her mother white water rafting
I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocking my U-Haul
Screaming, ""You ain't moving here""
""Lorena Bobbitt, come here, want a souvenir?
I've been high as ""L"" since I was a juven-eer
Juvenile? Same difference, I need some 'caine
Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants
Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'"

Canibus Impression Freestyle

[Sound effect: gunshot]

[EMINEM]

I’m a kick it
The motherfuckin’ liquid
That I be spittin’
Infinite ammunition
Yeah you wishin’
You try to step to this but you died
You tried to fuck with my style but get denied
And get hit
And get pushed back to the fuckin lab
When I stab you in the abdomen
When I grab a pen and jab it in

[EMINEM begins CANIBUS impression]

Travelin like an abdomen and gag you with it
Javelin when I’m stabbing it and grabbin it
With the Canibus animal animus
Element jam it is
Whatever lattice magnanimous
And the shadow is adamant
The equilibrium will lay on top of these mathematics
In alphabetical order, Destroyer!"

What’s Your Intent?

[Verse 1]
All them gangsta motherfuckers that went platinum
I had 'em hold out their hands and put a gat in 'em
Looked 'em in the faces and then spat in 'em
I picked the meanest Rott in this
Look at when it got in his face his daughter's swat to dot
His others gotten monotonous
'Cause all ya bitches swear ya made of cement
If you would've just had my fuckin money, I'd be straight as a split
But all ya multi-millionaires have never paid us in rent
So what a house and motherfuckers that never made us a cеnt

[Hook]
What's your intent?
I'm analyzing every cut your in to judgе your intent
I wanna know where you stand, I mean, as far as who you are
How would you act if you woke up and tomorrow you're a star?

[Verse 2]
I made a little change
Now they got me doin' some shows wit ho's in 'em
But I ain't change I still wear my clothes with holes in 'em
And wear my hair however I like
Bic it to stick it to slick it back, lick it back and then pat it down to spike
I'm happy to be alive and well
But it's probably way too happy be when you're survivin' hell
But in a way I think I'm kinda glad at that
'Cause I appreciate the good now that I've had it bad
Now I'mma run it back

[Hook]
What's your intent?
I'm analyzing every cut your in to judge your intent
I wanna know where you stand, I mean, as far as who you are
How would you act if you woke up and tomorrow you're a star?
What's your intent?

[Bridge]
What's your intent?
I wanna know
What's your intent?
Tell me what's your intent?

[Verse 3]
I come from where the folks of the family
Where there wasn't nothin' but funkin' and drug addicts and drug in our family
The only word that ever was to close was do or die

Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm a pacifist, unless there’s ass to kick
It'll be tragic miss, If I don't fuck you bitch
You can take the dick you little cunt
Lick it than pass it like a blunt
But I’m sober now I'm done with drugs
That was the last chapter this is the next one
My place in the game is big, son
I'm somewhere between God, Godzilla, and King Kong
A Monster, yeah like his dick is
They say I'm hung like a bear, so run, run bitches
The chainsaw can give you staple stitches
If your unfaithful, just kill your wife than rape your mistress
And if that don't work your a fucking retard
I'm sick of playing games, I'm here for revenge, Dee Barnes
Slapping up Dre for what he start-
Ed, long time ago and it left him scarred

[Chorus: Eminem]
Everybody knows I'm crazy
This game isn’t gonna change me
There’s nothing else to say, see
You already know I'm Shady
Everybody knows I’m crazy
This game isn't gonna change me
There's nothing else to say, see
You already know I'm Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
I’m assuming you don't want to battle
That will be your dying day
Into your house bullets will rattle
You just cannot win this fray
Don't believe me ask Ray (Cornrows)
(I heard he thinks he's gangsta), but he's really not though
(so don't fuck with Slim), that's the goal
(he'll burn your house down), and relocate you to the motorhomes
Holdin' pullin' moldin' chrome
Oldest, dopest, grossest flow
Killer, father, loving home
Family jealous of all this gold
Everybody wants a million from Shady
Even the goddamn motherfuckers who hate me
But I stays crazy, and sprayz AKs at babys
Me and Drezy (Yeah Slim your Shady)

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Mothefucker I told you I was (crazy)
The game done helped (shape me)
The only thing left to (say b)
Is hey (Slim your Shady)
Mothefucker I told you I was (Crazy)
The game done helped (Shape me)

Medicine Man (Only Eminem)

[Introduction]
Don't let me find out, the bitch in you
Don't let me find out, the snitch in you
Fame and fortune
It's not your forte
Fuck the world now
I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders
Go fuck yourself
Take two a day
Set them on an overdose
And kill yourself
Doctor's orders

[Chorus]
Say, what you living about
Fuck you gon' tell me
Do you remember how you started out though
You looking lost now
(You want a pass, oh damn)
Fake it 'til you make it
Take your little paper book
When you look in the mirror your credibility's gone now
I'd rather be hated on for who I am
Than to be loved for who I'm not
That's word to doc

[Verse 1]
In the few of the people who had a problem
I was this good, good, scoffed, I just shook off
Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf (golf)
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended, see how plain it was now, they want me to jet
No one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'till I took off
Mistook me because I look soft
But I stood tall, I just follow the (Doctor's orders)
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm 'posed to do alls
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter
I'm going in, already got an arm and head
And whoever said word are just words
Can't hurt me more than I give a fuck
Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned
In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like
They didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse, it's worth it
So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime
As sure as I'm always lying, in my mind
I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'mma go for mine
Like a whole furrow just trying ta dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to mothafuckin' find
I'm starting to slow and these lines are my nines
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign, been a (Doctor's)
Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, set with the blasters, give me the orders, I spray uh
Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waiting on someone to say something
Dre make the bass pump and let the tape run for old time's sake
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waiting for has come but

[Chorus]
Fame and fortune
It's not your forte
Fuck the world now
I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders
Go fuck yourself
Take two a day
Set them on an overdose
And kill yourself
Doctor's orders"

Hi, my name is, my name is nobody famous
Guess what? I'm an anus
I'm here with Mancow, haha
You know how I do it, cause I kick this fluid when i do it
I bust it, I kill it and I crush it with Mancow
You don't understand how we do it
We land now with hits and freestyle flows
Cuz we the ish, I said ish backwards and guess what that is...
Shhh, yea I can't say that, yo, hit the playback
Check it, cause rappers don't know how to display that
Rhymes that I be kicking, freestyle when I be kicking
Sticking these, ribs sticking out, poverty stricken
I'm all hungry cause I ain't ate in ten minutes
I'm infinite, oh, hey, check it out, I'm Ken Kaniff

Oh, hi there man, oh yeah
Hell no bro, oh yeah, no, yeah
Oh here I am I'm chillin' with Mancow
You know how we do it man you know we got the know how

Everything I Do

[Intro]
CDs ain't selling no more anyways, man
Look at SoundScan
I really don't think it matters if

[Hook]
Everything I do is number one, that makes you two
And that spells trouble for me and you
'Cause that's how beef starts between crews
And I don't mind if I debut at number two
So why do you? If we make money
Then why can't you be satisfied with what you do?

[Verse]
It's like our legacy's pregnant, we're planting eggs every record
They're beggin' me to release a CD every other second
But don't еxpect it, 'cause evеry time I get hit with that question
I just deflect it, get Ca$his or 50's record and check it
And Buck is out, like get these motherfuckers out 'fore I smack 'em
Plus T.I. just dropped an album now, go out and get that one
And I got a whole stable of artists who's able and fully capable
Of holdin' a label 'til I figure out when I'm ready to drop
Or maybe not, Shady, look how hot, you were on top
You were pop, you were so popular, now you're not
You're a washed up entrepreneur, how's it possible?
Well, it's not, if your little fickle minds would've caught on, but you didn't
See, I don't rap for the green, I mean, I ain't greedy
But I also know what it's like to be needy, and I will never
Go back to poverty, see, it ain't easy to try to step
Away from entertainment, separate it from CDs
And every day it just seems like we're beefin', even the media's
Meat eaters, they gotta give you something to read
Or you won't buy it, believe what you wanna believe
Let 'em feed to you, the BS, P.S., peace to T.I
You gon be 'aight and we out

[Hook]
Everything I do is number one, that makes you two
And that spells trouble for me and you
'Cause that's how beef starts between crews
And I don't mind if I debut at number two
So why do you? If we make money
Then why can't you be satisfied with what you do?

[Outro]
Peace
Hold a head up, partner
You know how we do what we gonna do
When we do it and we don't give a fuck what you're doin'
We gon' touchdown, back up in the private charter plane
We gon' touchdown, you know we gon' get it crackin' man
We gon' touchdown, I told you ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
With T.I. and Shady, baby, they gon' make a bigger riot
When we touchdown"

Rap Game (Bump Heads)

[Intro: Eminem, DJ Butter & D12 Member]
I am not a gay basher (bash faggots)
Shit happens y'all
The rap game, hip-hop 101
The hardest nice to five you'll ever have
You can't remember shit in no history book
You ready to rap motherfucker?
You ready to sell your soul?
Ha, ha, ha, ha
The rap game will fuck you

[Verse 1: D12 Member]
I'm a disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
You shoulda slayed me as a baby
Behavin' shadier the Wes Craven
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me, punk it's over, you'll faint fast
I've never fucked up to where I can't whoop your ass
You'll neck'll will get snapped with bare hands, fuck music
Is he rappin'? It's cool but fools, just don't confuse it
What happens, these dudes get rude, then I lose it
I m scandalous, I blow your two kids off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger then Godzilla's back, nigga
You are not realer, in fact you'll feel the effects
Of a crack dealer, y'all president since we smacked
And got a Mac-10 with it, so I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that, don't mistakin' me black
'Cause you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm a get snuffed, 'cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I pipe down when the White House is wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dyke get sniped out
Lights out, bitch, adios, goodnight
Now put that in your little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute 'cause the hype had died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that seed Deloris, tell the slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker ducked, what the fuck? Son of a bitch
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade, with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword and since he
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that utslay itchbay
Upsay my ipnay, 'scuse my igpay atinlay
But uckfay, it pays

[Chorus: Eminem & D12 Member]
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin you, no, it ain't happening
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap game

[Verse 3: D12 Member]
I bet ya lovin me (??), drink and drown in my own iniquity
But fuck that, I m gonna rap till y all get sick of me
And clutch my last sack, it s been all who big on me
I m pickin a rot mix, fuck the dog who single me
I m saying you motherfuckers, don t know ith, who playin
If I m broke, then I m brakin open the place where you layin
You know, same she every nigga done in his life
I livin this why (??), speak long (??), what I blow when I write
So why, should i, ever fear another man, if he bleed like I bleed
Take a piss when he stand, ok you win, you can say we can't rap
But no shots (??), never me (??), you never (??), and I don t wanna (??)
When they say it was wack...

I walk in the party and just start bustin
Right after I hear the last of self destruction
This liquer makes me wanna blast the chrome
To let you know that time without morse dangerom (??), (nigga)
I low down and shifty, quickly call swifty
To do a drive-by on the ten speed with fifty
You feelin lucky squeeze, I catch you outside of chucky cheese
With you see (??) who be unlucky g, my lifestyle is unstable
A partyin addict, they said no fightin in the club
So I brought me a matic, coughin the static
I jump nigga s call me a rabbit
Pop in the tavern and guns are so just irratic...

Believe me, we run this rap shit forchezy
Make makin millions look easy
Everywhere you turn you see me
You hear me

Believe me, you see my pistol and three dead
No time to call the peace treaty
Dial 911 cause you need the...,
Police to help you, believe me

I haft to tunnel from the side walk and piss on the curve
This is obserde, these street nigga s twistin my words
We finally could say goodbye to hollywood
Cause boots and shine pants, is nothin in commin
The nasty been with gasoline cans (??)
We never bow down to be a flashin a pig (??)

No one must, fuck this statue dawg
Nothin to do with hands when I clap with yall
Put your job on the ground (??), then the dog in the pound (??)
Then I m goin out of town, for the law come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle gats
Matter a fact we can battle with placks

(eminem)

This rap game

(bizarre)

I m too fuckin retarted, I don t give a fuck about my dick
Thats why I m date in raymond bobbet
My crew had a arguement who was the largest
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
Plus I made the beat to all the raps
Well I really didn't but I did according to this contract
I was thrown in the snow with no where to go
Freezin 20 below forced to join, bail shit, then blow (??)
My little girl, she should nt listen to these lyrics
Thats why I glued here headphones to her ears
To make sure she hear it
If rap don t work I m startin a group with garth brooks
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
This ain t the hook... (??)"

Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay
You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White
So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight
Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford, forty and white, lethargic ass dickhead
I keep 'em comin while you runnin out of breath
Steady duckin while I'm punchin at your chest, you need to rest
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
With your three CD's, nobody sees, when they released
Evidence, don't fuck around with
Real
MC's
Who ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks
I let you faggots know it's on for life
But Everlast might die tonight, haha
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know

[Chorus: Eminem]
Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute
Honkey, I hit 'em up

Hahaha, yo
Check
This out
You faggots ain't even on my level
I'ma let D-12 ride on you bitch-made ass fa**ots

[Verse 2: Kon Artist]
Yo, Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Whitey Ford's heart just stopped
Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack
Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin back
Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are
At your own restaraunt, while I'm servin ya
Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops
Call the cops, I'ma beat your ass while they watch

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik
Where's your House of Pain now? There's only one of you Erik
You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round
With some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfuckin Belle Isle Bridge

[Chorus: Eminem]
Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute
Honkey, I hit 'em up

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
This ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin killed
With his chest open
Tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin
Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
Cause you SUCK motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
Talkin 'bout you packin pistols but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale
On his way to fuckin prison, pistol whippin tail, ha
Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha
Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop
Forty-nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop
While my
Sales
Makin records break
Two and a half million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker I hit 'em up

[Verse 5: Proof]
I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave., where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music, we got an uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated you violated
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
Iriscience get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches get your throats cut

[Verse 6: Swifty]
What the fuck?! Is you stupid?
I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin guitar cord
And
Stuff
Him in cardboard, chopped up in a box
With sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart
D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaraunt locked and block your door
Cause we ""Hit 'Em Up"" like motherfuckin 2Pac Shakur

[Verse 7: Eminem]
You a, ""Black Jesus,"" heart attack seizures
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
White devil, washed up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country

Yo, aiyyo cut this shit off
Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it

God damn I quit

The Wake Up Show Freestyle

[Verse 1]
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off, and beat him over the head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with a 40
Mix it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44D
Forget an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in, and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
We blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of Holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers?
We blowin' up your housе, killin' your parents
Comin' back to get your foster mamas
And I'm as good at keepin' your promisе as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam War Vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more, 'cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al. B Sure!

[Verse 2]
It's only fair to warn: I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two-by-four board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an A Capella
To chop a fella' to Mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar, with your skeleton showin'
Developin' anorexia, while I'm standin' next to ya'
Eatin' a four-course meal, watchin' you starve to death
With an IV in your vein, feedin' you liquid Darvocet
Pumpin' you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gun shop victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven to recievin'
With the asses ripped outta they' pants
And given a less than a 20% chance of livin'
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storin' the dead bodies in Grandma's little basement
Dr. Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you, while you scream: ""I'm still alive!""
Drivin' a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pullin' your Adam's Apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpet, and burn up your entire apartment"
