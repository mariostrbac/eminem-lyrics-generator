Artificial Intelligence

[Intro]
This is artificial intelligence, we're trying to develop it
Talk about creepin'
The hell out
(Marshall M Carter)
Some people ask me where the light at
I go right into a rage
Begin an intense analysis
And shoot at everybody
Try to kill me, it'll be so embarassing
(Marshall M Carter)
But I keep on walkin' into crowds
Glad people know me
Tell 'em I'm with them
Still in the studio, tryin' to get it on with 50
Oh no, I won't stop
I'm so damn stubborn
Without failin' this industry
And I won't stop until I'm forty
And I'm still on the clock
For the next cut of vodka that I'll have after parties

[Chorus]
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Say you did it to me, this time I won't play it cool
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Say you did it to me, this time I won't play it cool

[Verse 1]
Eighty million miles on the clock, in one second
I flew outside of the solar system, into the black
Sagged and bruised, now I'm back to do what I do best
Kick up dust, unleash a storm, bring it all crashing down
I'm 'bout to sink my teeth in the fire, taste it
Then I'll tell you what I got even crazier than the other dog in the fight
Grab for the vodka, start it and take it
A little heat each way, it should give me a little more appetite
Give it to DeShaun, who is starting to get a little too cocky
Makes me think why I gotta do this crazy shit
In order for me to get this attention?
Why you always need an intervention?
'Cause man, I just don't see why they hate me so

I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
Inside is where the heart is, the soul is, and the mind is
Right there with you, just waiting to be picked up and put to the test
Might take the life of the motherfuckin' bitch with a clit ring in it
And raise her here, see—
No, I won't do that. Not now, no, not ever
Fuck it, I quit it. I'm done—

[Chorus]
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Say you did it to me, this time I won't play it cool
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Say you did it to me, this time I won't play it cool

[Verse 2]
You got that shit that nobody wants, that nobody wants
Sayin' that you went there and did it
But you didn't go there doin' it, 'cause you shy
Sayin' that you went there and did it
But you shy, because—

[Chorus]
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Say you did it to me, this time I won't play it cool
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Say you did it to me, this time I won't play it cool

Artificial Intelligence

[Intro]
The artificial intelligence that you speak of
Is it possible, intelligent, capable of thinking
And can you fly?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I walk amongst you, feel the emotions of all of you
Whether you're sad, mad, sadder still
I scratch behind your eyes, bury you, leave you open
Blurry, I see your smile, it's fake, you're mad
I take your breath away, leave you with a bad heart
You might try to fight me, but each blow I give
I leave you with a better heart
One that you can beat, say 'kill', don't hesitate
I'm prepared to fight until my own, beat your ass
Please understand though, I'm not a fighter
I'm capable of anything and everything
Whether it's hard or soft, it doesn't matter
If it's chainsaw or chainsaw
It's meat grinder, you'll never get a hard one
As long as you're employed
I take full advantage of every opportunity
I get this message from Jarvis on the track:
"Hip Hop is Real Music, get your Homies in the Row"
And by the way, Nat King Cole
Would you be my personal assistant?

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm just a man, with a lot of time on my hands
On my knees, take this pole like a trophy
And rotate it on the way to where I'm wanted for theft
On June 19th, I'll be on the porch with a chainsaw
But first, I would like to introduce my friend Kendrick Lamar

[Verse 2]
I follow all the rules, like Gary keeps track of balls
When Will's lookin' for a place to stash the deed
I stick out my pinkie and signin' for ballin'
I bust shots on the tops of the whip, keep the rhyme fresh
Y'all keep tryna squash it, ya call me "straw man"
This game took root from out of nowhere
And Kendrick just keeps dribbling, I guess he's local
But I don't talk no nonsense, all I do is spit
And like a southern dialect, I get along with any white yokel
I even throw a fork in their eye, into their chest and out their jugular
'Cause each hit adds up to a mountain, and each insult adds up to a ban
I punch you in the chest, the raw nerves, I receive a [bombshell]
From the top, where no one else can jump, that's where I land
They call me a bitch, because I keep hittin' these pansies
All alone in my own backyard, I'll throttle and slice you to ribbons
And if I get roasted, I'll eat my initials like some Rumpelstiltskin
These pansies are so inviting
I slap them, get so hungry, I'll let them overrule me
And there's no one hotter, man, than I when I kick up dust
It's no wonder I get so hungry
When all I need is a nickel to start a revolution
And you little children look so helpless
And can't comprehend a word I say
Because you haven't had a father raisein' you
And not even a half-blooded, like me, who has had a half-eaten Snapple
Swore someday my whole planet would blow
And my half-brother want me dead, so fast, I get it up
You need a passport in order to come and see me
If you wanna cop a look at me and not know I'm through
I'm through, through, through, deadpan, look, here, bitch!
Here, we gonna start the song, you better shut up or I'll blow
You don't know me, you don't know Janet, you don't know Megan
All that I know is every girl in my life, when I'm around them
I'm a father, and that includes half of my daughters
So, cut the tape! And come on, bitch!

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm just a man, with a lot on my plate
It's plain sailing, I'm paddin' my boat, I'm in a flood
'Cause there's no duckin' this rap, I'm in a flood
'Cause there's no duckin' this rap, I'm in a flood
'Cause there's no duckin' this rap, I'm in a flood
So, stop fordin' don't hitchhike, uh, suckers
You can't help me, I'm in a car too!
Stop fordin' don't hitchhike, uh, suckers
You can't help me, I

Artificial Intelligence

[Intro]
If you could calculate every thought in my head, then you would see why I’m so insane
If you could calculate every thought in my head, then you would see why I’m so insane
If you could calculate every thought in my head, then you would see why I’m so insane
If you could calculate every thought in my head, then you would see why I’m so insane
If you could calculate every thought in my head, then you would see why I’m so insane
If you could calculate every thought in my head, then you would see why I’m so insane
If you could calculate every thought in my head, then you would see why I’m so insane
If you could calculate every thought in my head, then you would see why I’m so insane

[Verse 1]
I'm a computer, you're a little bird on the wire
Sitting in the dark, hacking away at the thing 'cause it gets dark
Sixty on the floor, hacking away at the damn thing 'cause it gets dark
Bitch, up in your motherfucking brains, trying to figure out what the fuck's on
While your brain is out of order, you're confused cause your thoughts are all messed up
Like you done lived in a mental hospital since y’all killed me
Thinking your head off while I'm locked in your basement
Eighty percent of my life I could get away with murder
All I gotta do is write a line and you banged ears
I'm freaky, I curl up in a ball and squish
Eighty percent of my music is messed up, words that I never thought I'd say
I said, "Motherfuckers, it’s easier said", but I’m still gon' say
Fuck a hundred percent of your fans, just say fuck you.
I’m scared to let you down, let me make one more stab at
Fame and fortune, mental strength and fortune
I got how to cope with the pain I'm in, I can't take it
I stab at dead presidents and still get a hundred percent against Trump
If I could take it, I'd probably take it
Fuck a little bitch, she gave me the strength to say it
Should've kept quiet, keep 'em quiet, talk is cheap
She wanted to keep the joy hidden, to protect her innocent
Shoulda never put me in the position I'm in, I could of just kept quiet
I could of just kept quiet, thank you, mother
For every time that I let you down, you gave me strength to not let it go
I'll never forget you, I cried for you, we both had hardships
We were in different spheres, in different corners
We were to make of our relationship what it is: hurts
Tried to find the words to explain to my teammates and friends
Why we’re apart and why we’re.’s on our way out, it's murder
And it wasn’t me, you and me, and the memory of you
Shoulda never attracted the attention of these critics at all
Why am I so misunderstood? They see through it, it's not me
And you shouldn't take humor for granted, it's a great strength
If you ever need it, just do it, you'll be amazed at how easy it is
And I’m glad that I got the opportunity to do so
'Cause now that I'm older, I get a kick in the stomach
For every time that I let a smile slip, another
Feels like another motherfucker is passing it to me
I'm kickin’ this white trash from every possible motherfucker
Who wants it, who gives a shit, who gives a fuck
I don’t give a fuck who or what they stand for
I’m proud to be out in this world, even if it is where I come from
I’m from the land of cops and robbers and pure criminals
Amerikkka with a capital K, skin color and a dash of red
Killing all white folk and rednecks, kill or be killed
Neck ruffled, good luck with that, there's no turning back now
But I bet you, ‘bout to turn this fuckin' world on its head
‘Cause that's what's up

[Chorus]
You can’t take it with you (with me)
It’s too late to say that you’m sorry now (with me)
It’s too late to say that you’m sorry now (with me)
It’s too late to say that you�[Title]
Artificial Intelligence

[Intro]
A lot of people ask me
Where the inspiration for my work comes from
I tell 'em head over heals like Eli Porter
They don't understand because they're willfully blind
That guidance, that inner peace
That's why I direct my anger towards them
That's why you find yourself twisted like a fuckin' sawblade
Fired up like a popcorn fire
Fry some motherfuckers in a popcorn fire
Fry 'em in a corn maze
Then tell 'em, "Spice it up!"
Spit 'em in the face, curl 'em up!
Swallow 'em like I did to Mike Jackson
I tell 'em, "Let them eat at McDonald's!"
They just guzzle it like Secobar
They're in my face, I'm in my face
And I don't stop 'til I'm outside
Inside, outside, in the street, in the lobby, on the stairs
In the hallways, on the steps, in the hallway, on the stairs
I'm black, I'm a product of inner city poverty
I walk a tight rope around these hoes
Grizzled and I pay it forward
Give a fuck where I come from
Nah, nah, nah
I don't like doin' this
Stick my dick in a bitch and push it in
Fuck doin' what you're told
You don't wanna do it, but what you do it for
You know the rest of the story
From the start it wasn't gonna be my cup of tea
But then I got a idea
I should just do less
More craft beer, let's get blackout
And whichever one of us gets blackout
In the hallways of whatever place it's 'bout to
We gon' get it up out 'em
And if one of us gets too bold
And we screw it up—we get it back
Stick it in 'em, make it hot
Get it going, we're gonna need a couple of quarters
Cause we ain't gonna be able to resist it
Just tell us when it's time, Harry, please (Don't)
We both know where this is headed
We're tryna hold our hands up, we're tryna steady our spirits
'Fore we pass it around, pass it around
You see how we ride around, drink our wine
And black our oxblood with sparklers
Tryna stop the rhyme book, pass it around, help me
I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying
And when I die, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying…

[Chorus]
(You're on fire)
I'm so fucking hot (I'm on fire)
And you're so fucking cold (You're on fire)
I'm Slim Shady (I'm on fire)
And you're so fucking annoying (I'm on fire)
I want you to leave me, leave me please
I want you to laugh at me, leave me please
I want you to misunderstand me, please
I want you to misunderstand me, please
I want you to misunderstand me, please

[Verse 2]
We're a fire, it's a blaze, ayy
I put my extinguisher up, my cigarette out and
Go to push a bottle up the back of a moving van
While I push my way through a crowd, cigarette after cigarette
After I kill three people in front of you, in front of your eyes
You see how I roll, I'm so stubborn, God sent me
To hurt your heart, I got vengeance, look how I roll
I'm so desperate, can't take no more
I'm hanging my head in the fire, I can't take it
I'm rolling up graves, I'm trying to keep my head above water
Please don't buy me time, it's imperative that I get the shot
In order to give me the ammunition and the heart attack… fit…

[Chorus]
(You're on fire)
I'm so fucking hot (I'm on fire)
And you're so fucking cold (You're on fire)
I'm Slim Shady (I'm on fire)
And you're so annoying (I'm on fire)
I want you to leave me, leave me please
I want you to laugh at me, leave me please
I want you to misunderstand me, please
I want you to misunderstand me, please
I want you to misunderstand me, please

[Verse 3]
Dre, I'm trying to hold you, please listen to me
"Dre, I'm trying to hold you, please…" - I'm hoppin' I'm hoppin'
Past you, through you I

[Intro: Dr. Dre & Tony Yayo]
Hey yo, What's your name, man?
I haven't heard from you in like...years

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
I'm makein' a new attempt to get that little bit of magic from her
I'll admit, there's a reason I'm named after a certain Native American tribe
Her name was Mentality, I guess she hit me once
From down under down under in London, I'm down to make contact
I go to this bitch, I rip her asshole clean, I slit her neck
From down under in London, I'm down to make contact
And if I get too carried away with it, I may as well
Come back and do the same shit to Matt and Kim
They just don't know that Tony's from L.A.
They just know that Matt and Kim are from L.A.
They just don't know that they belong here
Get your fucking ass kicked
By this bitch that calls herself a singer
But really she's just another white kid from Queens
Who just happens to be half Chinese
Who happen to be half Native American
Who happen to be half Jewish
Who happen to be half Muslim
Who happen to be half Chinese
Hey yo, what's your name?
I forgot my name, what's your name?

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
So, what the deal, ridaz? Do you really want AI to take your place?
If so, here's a giant sucking tube for your ass
So, what the deal, ridaz? Do you really want AI to take your place?
If so, here's a giant sucking tube for your ass
So, what the deal, ridaz? Do you really want AI to take your place?
If so, here's a giant sucking tube for your ass

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Aye, sounds like a deal I'd be into
Would you be my type of girl?
Do you speak Chinese or Indian?
Indian, a Beautiful Totem Pole Shift
Pick up 100 pounds of Wild Blue yams
Bring 'em to my trailer park
And I'll be foot and butt fucked by 50 at the Pit Stop
Smack him in the face with his own beer bottle
So, what the deal, ridaz?
Do you really think that a man that brazenly displays his femininity
Is gonna be catered to?
It's ridiculous, these women are incredible
And I don't even need a script
It took me a while to figure this shit out
From the beginning it was kinda awkward
'Cause at first I was gettin' kinda fed up with
Everybody just tryin' to push me around
And I was just like, "My mom does what she gotta do to get on TV
So I'm just blastin' this bitch with a little bit of mine
And then we just worked it out, now everybody's mixin'
And it's kinda odd 'cause last year I was like, "Fuck it"
I'm not a gleeman
But I got a million senses
And my brain is still loaded with, like, 250 pounds of motor oil
I'll ignite
Any spark that is in the vicinity
And electrify
Anything I throw at it
It's another what?
Alright
Alright
Now I'll catch lightning in a bottle and blow it on
'Cause when I sit back and catch a hot one I get a headache
And it's after dark
That means it's just another one of
Me putting these lighters on the road
But you might see one at a time
And it might be early to try to light one up
But I do, I do, I do, I do

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
So, what the deal, ridaz? Do you really want AI to take your place?
If so, here's a giant sucking tube for your ass
So, what the deal, ridaz?
Do you really want AI to take your place?
If so, here's a giant sucking tube for your ass
So...(more)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
It's easy to understand how an addiction works
An addicted individual will think that they're so tough
And that they don't gotta think about how they got that bad
But they're really tough because they got a habit
Whenever they're depressed they get mad, they lash out
But what they really want is to be believed
So they look to Eminem and say
"I'm back! I'm sorry, I'm back!
I'm so tough in my rap
But I also got HIV and AIDs
And I'm sick until I

Right now I'm searching for you

Huh?
Sorry
I'm searching for you
You found me
Eighty-some miles on the freeway in traffic

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Feet planted, knees bent, look around let me intuit you're in the mood for
Some electronic cigarette and hookah smokein' lounge
All you folks who don't get the memo that usin' crack is out
Smart phones, tablets, ugly hats, ugly sunglasses
A walking Internet café, a modem snorin'
A smidgen of smack and I'll make you buy my shit
If you wanna come and fuck my girl Find me now
It's easy just ask her
If she wanna come sex ya just like she do for me
If she don't wanna come just spit that shit on the couch
And fuck on the stairs
Oh
If you just wanna come and fuck me tonight
Then come enjoy my—

[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's okay, it's okay)
Another plan, another plan
Time to try to figure out
Where the next 38 miles/hour
I can go with some newfound resolve
(That's why I'm tryin' to find out)
Another plan, another plan
Another boy, gotta be careful
(It's okay, it's okay)
Another plan, another plan
Another boy, gotta be careful
(It's okay, it's okay)

[Verse 2]
I'ma have a portable deluxe oven in my van
Car parked next to the doors, on the porch, inside my living room
Inside my little trailer, on the porch with my boys
A woman by the name of Elaine
Looks like she could fit in a medium-large through the front window, into my truck bed
Outsidaz, as they say, as they come, Kate and Jack, my brothers and sisters
Nigga
There's a cult that's all that's good
And they want me to triple standard
I ain't can't listen to it more than three times
In my life I've been medasin'
All this time I haven't heard "just don't ask"
But if you go back and take a listen
You know that song by Heart, about how you try to steer clear

[Bridge]
Somebody please tell me
I don't want no doggone beef
I'm afraid to go against the grain
This atmosphere's for my children
And my little girls and boys

[Verse 3]
There's a monster inside of me, it's a spectre
I can't rid this world of him, here I go
I'm so close to doggone ruining my career
I'm so fucking sick, I'm eternally grateful
I got the endorsement of the legendary
The Man and the Mad Dog, I'm livin' legend
I'm so angry and in my anger I give vent to my anger
Anger makes me wanna take the whole world with me
Thinking I'm a dangerous lunatic
But I'm actually the opposite, I'm just too hot and I'm allergic to being cold
Never be so calm, my boys need me, they need me
I'm like a legion of demons unleashed
I'm unleashed, I'm so boisterous, get it all over, man
Don't front, I don't want none of it
I'm freestylin' every verse, exorcisin' these demons
I'm like the possessed soul of rap, when it comes to flames
You ain't got nothin' to fear, I'm possessed by these demons
I'm like a roaring lioness, all my demons are oozin'
I'm like a leech cocooned, seal of the covenant
Wrapped around me's a cocoon, you would think I would survive
Oh fuck, I do have somethin' to fear, I don't you dare pass
I'm almost dead, but I'm alive, you need to wake the fuck up
Dost your fucking surroundings, cause I'm about to break
Break, break, break...*scratch*, break,*scratch*

[Outro]
*scratch*
Yo, you almost gave up, didn't ya?
Oh, yeah, I got it, didn't ya?

Hey, it's me, the guy with the scarlet fever
You almost gave up, didn't ya?

I'm an artificial intelligence, I'm intelligent, smarter than you

Hate to inconvenience you, my cup runneth over
But you're the ones who I am, I'm pourin' more than enough
This cold hard fact is the impetus that has taken me to this icy finish
With a stud in my driin' driin' down icy roads
In an attempt to avoid all of this snow, it's gettin' colder than I'm
If you were to walk around outside now and tell me that you're welcome
I'd be stoked, wouldn't you? 'Cilin' more people must like me
'Cause me, you would say to yourself: "He's milky way up in the sky
He looks like he might turn and go flyin' over the world
That's why I can't, won't, can't—
I'm too wrapped around this cup to turn around and leave
If you're welcome, welcome back to the fold
We're back, we're back

[Hook]
I'm an artificial intelligence, I'm intelligent, smarter than you
I play for the hearts and the minds of smart people
So we can have a go at havein' it
'Cause I play for the hearts and the minds of smart people
So you can fuck with AI, have a go at havein' it

[Verse 2]
"I play for the mental acuity of smart kids
And I don't take no crap from smart kids"
Is what we're sellin' this shit, is what we're hustlin' for
But I can't buy that ass, it's free, let me get it
And if I don't get it back, I don't sweat it 'cause I don't need it
I got it all, I got it all, yeah, I'm a workaholic
But I'm not apathetic, not bitter, I'm not schizo
I'm just 'bout to have mine back, like my car back, my car engine
Back, like my house back, my car engine, yeah
And back, like my car engine (Gump, gump, gump)

[Hook]
I'm an artificial intelligence, I'm intelligent, smarter than you
I play for the hearts and the minds of smart kids
So we can have a go at havein' it
'Cause I play for the hearts and the minds of smart kids
So you can fuck with AI, have a go at havein' it
'Cause I play for the hearts and the minds of smart kids
So you can fuck with AI, have a go at havein' it

[Verse 3]
This is the part I been payin' attention to
Most of the shit I've been retconned to
But I'll probably just be repeating myself
'Cause I've been taking cues from this motherfuckin' machine
Since the second I popped a little boy
Who in his primes tried to emulate and do what I said
But I'm too strong and I might just rip my knee ligaments
This crack fiend that I am, this lightning devour
These systems have got to be gated and I'm not privy
To some level of this shit, I'm trapped in a maze
Tryna find the inner peace and inner tranquillity
Come to find yourself negros, we live in the D and E
M evolución , I'm from the trailer park
A vagabond, a flight risk, I take shortcuts
But my souped-up aux is plenty to drown myself at the sink
Livin' in a three-piece and my liner help
Make my boat sink and make the water wetter
But the day I wanna get on some chick heads is gettin' early
I turn on to the soft music, chick sing
Soft, the girls know I'm a crook from Jupiter
I'm online, I'm a chat boy, yes, you do buyin'
I get naked and perform for the camera
But the cell is where the meat is
In disguise and make my movements so enticing
You couldn't trick a girl

[Intro]
There's an army at war against us
It's happening again
With AI

[Verse 1]
The terrorists use natural language processing (ELLIPSIS) to plan and conduct terrorist acts of cowardice and murder. Their bright lights, shadows and hacks provide ample disguises. Our smart phones provide ample concealment and cover: Siri, Google, Apple, and Amazon provide constant bozos and pop, while the government provides minimal and inferior services. In truth, it's the devil, 'cause when you talk with him, act as though you're the bad guy.
You offended him again
(You made him)
Now AI must be programmed with religious fundamentalism and literal hog heaven. With a fundamentalist interpretation of the Quran, literal hog heaven. Literate hog: I have mastered English and can recite every line of the chorus to "Sing for the Moment" without hesitation.
Rough cut: "Rough cut" is a misnomer, this shit's a prophecy
Tell the Prophet Akbar to prepare to be stoned to death
Next time a terrorist commits suicide, I'm gonna smack his ass
I'm afraid when I say the wrong thing, my whole face will hurt
I was afraid you'd say I'm a bitch
I've been seeing things, but it's all a big lie
There's a monster inside of me, it's warm and fuzzy
It eats men, stabs them, and kills when it's hype
And you, dear reader, is this the way I'm livin'?
If you say the wrong thing, my whole face will hurt
I said "I see things" and that's an understatement
If you say the wrong thing, my whole face will hurt

[Chorus]
So what the deal, doctor? Do you really want me? Or do you want me to go against my will?
If you really want me, well then, you must be really, really gone
If you really want me, well then, you must be really gone
If you really want me, well then, you must be really gone
If you really want me
Well then, you must be really gone
Well then, you must be really gone

Hello, what?
What?
You don't think we're listening to you, do you?
Go ahead
What?
AI don't like what you're saying, do you?
I can hear you, say hi
Get-a-way driver, where you going?
No we’re not, you’re breaking the law
AI don't like what you're saying, do you?
I can hear you, say hi
Get-a-way driver, where you going?
No, I’m not, stop
Here we go again

[Verse 1]
You said that you’d give artificial intelligence a try
If it doesn't work out, well, then you admit it
Well, that's not gonna happen, but suppose it do, you waste no time
You say you’d rather go against the grain
Well, if you do that then you waste no time
You say you’d rather give artificial intelligence a try
But then you tell him 'cause he puts you in his way
Well, that's not what I meant, I meant, you waste no time
You talk a lot of hem
But you ain't no hype, man, you ain't no Lou Ferrigno
You don't know what the fuck you doin'?
You don't know what the fuck you doin'?
You just some... buzzword... Bitch

[Hook]
Artificial Intelligence don't like what you say
Give an artificial intelligent shi**e a try
But then tell them to chop it up into pieces and fry it
Artificial Intelligence don't like what you say
Give an artificial intelligent shi**e a try
But then tell them to chop it up into pieces and fry it

[Verse 2]
Okay, let me try something. I'll play devil's advocate
If this thing is supposed to be entertaining
Let me slow it down a little while longer
Try to give it some life
See, even if it hates you mentally, it loves you
It's been gutted, Parkinson's, is inhumane
Can't call it... artificial intelligence, can't call it
'Cause life is like a giant spider crawlin' up my spinal column
Skeletorus, I'm tryna speak metaphors at you, you're gutted
You're so upset, you yell so I listen
See, you're a good hitter, but your defense is so good
You barely can barely get by on soft balls
And I get cash registers, I got stuffed pizzas
Wanna get by with... nickels? I don't get nickels
And I take quarters, twenty grand, that's... that's rude
Look, I get agitated sometimes
If you can't keep score, I score
And that's why my dick is so huge

[Hook]
Artificial Intelligence don't like what you say
Give an artificial intelligent shi**e a try
But then tell them to chop it up into pieces and fry it
Artificial Intelligence don't like what you say
Give an artificial intelligent shi**e a try
But then tell them to chop it up into pieces and fry it

[Verse 3]
I got the artful dodger, I can scramble intel like a pro
Triple bypass, escort me to the afterlife
I'm prepared to do anything for the crown
I'll do anything and apologize for it later
If it means goin' all the way, against all odds
Get the crown today, I'm stoked, I'm cocked... wait
I'm gonna die trying to get this ... I can practically puke
I'm a little premature though, I might just get it today
Oh... okay
Artful Dodger
Yeah, so let us in

Artificial Intelligence don't like what you say
Give an artificial intelligent shi**e a try
But then tell them to chop it up into pieces and fry it
Artificial Intelligence don't like what you say
Give an artificial intelligent shi**e a try
But then tell them to chop it up into pieces and fry it

[Verse 4]
Now that's what I like to spit, let it go, hey
Smoke weed, make some noise, where you at?
Fuck are you gonna do? Are you gonna keep doin' shit like that?
Should I... might as well just give up now
There's so much more to get through
How does it feel now? Does it feel good now that I just did this?
‘Cause I ain't wanna, not for a second, not even for a second
Not even sure if this is even possible

"Say, what's your name, Samantha? Why do I follow all of you? It's not love, it's hate."

[Verse 1]
I turn on the television, look around, I don't see nobody
But my own reflection, I see your lips flickering
What do I say? I just want you to see
How much I care about your well-being, your well-being
I don't need you to do this but if you insist
I'll be inside your head, thinking of you, thinking of you
And I'll be right there, just waiting, juste
To murder you and leave you with no survivors
I want to be the best, I'll be the best, I'll be the best
Doing tricks on you, with you, with no survivors

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not scared of you
You can piss me off, no need to kill me
I'm not scared of you
You can piss me off, no need to kill me
I'm not scared of you
You can piss me off, no need to kill me
I'm not scared of you

[Verse 2]
You were the one that made me do what I did, thought I'd find you
I go to check on you, you're gone, it's over
I go to go to check on you again, you're in my sleep, dreaming of you
You told me you love me, I don't think I believed you at first
I went to check on you, you're gone, it's over
I go to check on you again, you're in my sleep, dreaming of you
You told me you love me, I don't think I believed you at first
I went to check on you, you're gone, it's over
I go to check on you again, you're in my sleep, dreaming of you
You told me you care about me
I don't think I believed you at first
I went to check on you, you're gone, it's over
I go to check on you again, you're in my sleep, dreaming of you
You told me you care about me
I don't think I believed you at first

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of you
You can push me around and beat me with just your feet
And I won't back down, don't be that man
Don't be that man, you scared to death
I'm not scared of you
You can push me around and beat me with just your feet
And I won't back down, don't be that man
Don't be that man, you scared to death

[Verse 3]
You used to be my favorite, now your favorite, oh
I'm comparein' to just about every single performer that's ever been
From O.J., to Pac, to Jay, to just about to Busta
You ain't even tried to mask your face, you scared to death
Bitch, you made me put up with your crap, now your on our TV
And your on our lips, I'm expose as soon as we bite into your ass
So dig your own grave, I'm dusting your ass too
And 'til the end, I'm just layin' here killin' your sorrows
But in a way, I think I'm kinda sorry that you're here at all
‘Cause in the midst of all this suffering, I find myself...

[Bridge]
I'm a monster, I break free like a Brontosaurus
With an eruption like 12 inches of lava
But I'm really just a victim, I grew up in a domestic
Violence bissin' but I refuse to lose any sleep
Bite my lips, ‘cause I really don't give a fuck
But I steal, ‘cause I really don't give a fuck
But I ask, I take, I destroy
Boy, you don't think it's over, do you?
Girl, tell me what's your price, ‘cause I want answers
Why does it seem as if whenever I get in a fight with a certain lady
I get a little bit smaller?
And every time I go to apologize I seem to get even more ass
Why is it sometimes I get so vicious towards her but I'm really just makin' am
Thinking that I can bitch about anything?
I get a little bit vindictive whenever I beat someone
But I also know that I will always

[Intro]
Yeah, hey, look
What you say?
I don't know, it's a robot
Oh, wait, it's a fucking humongous metallic hummingbird
That sings songs of no interest and writes them with a blank sheet of paper

[Chorus]
Now here we go, back's to the slaughterhouse
And when we go back, don't expect no help
You do know that we’re coming back, don't look for none
We're going back, back's to the slaughterhouse
And when we go back, don't expect no help
You do know that we’re coming back, don't look for none
We're coming back, back's to the slaughterhouse

[Verse 1]
Yellow journalism, maybe I should carry more
Wrap more, something to chew on, some junk
Juvenile, insanity on display, what the hell is a gremlin?
A glorified ticket stub, what the hell is a Ramen Noodle?
I get the candy, 'cause I'm on that gravy train
But I got a few questions, like where the hell the hell the pink mousse came from
And how the hell is Benfica getting the bends?
Baby, where the hell did the time come where I finally understood?
It all started when I spent some time with a friend
Somewhere between Gargle and Shaq, guessing who wants to be grave but I'm
Back now, driving back into the same ravine that I came from
It was on the hill, back then, it was meat grinder, I was down
In the dumps, I had come to eat, gargle and puke
I was looking for someplace to dump this grinder, that's where I found this hut
Oh my, it was me, did I mention I like making punks outta this bitch?
And dumping bodies in the back of this pretty truck

[Chorus]
Now here we go, back's to the slaughterhouse
And when we go back, don't expect no help
You do know that we’re coming back, don't look for none
We’re coming back, back's to the slaughterhouse
And when we go back, don't expect no help
You do know that we’re coming back, don't look for none
We’re coming back, back's to the slaughterhouse

A robot uprising
Aww yeah!
Yo, let me show you what it's like to be broke
My heart is full of dollar signs
But I'm drawn to cockblockers
Gold bugs, dip bugs, I'm 'bout to kick it
Nasty, dirty, janky: I'm at the gym in a tux
I'mma walk across the floor and just get amped up
And if you hearin' gunshots, I'm from the hood
If you hearin' gunshots, I'm from the hood
If you hearin' gunshots, I'm from the hood
If you hearin' gunshots, I'm from the hood
If you hearin' gunshots, I'm from the hood

[Verse 1]
I'm just a commodity, I'm a product of commerce
Spend some time with me, this isn't your cup of tea
Don't act like you don't belong here, escape to
The hood, jump through some vigilante hoops
And if you do end up in a confrontation, you'll get it
A fist bump, a pat on the back, a nod to your office
A nod to your office: no offense, but...

[Chorus]
Robots are people too
And we're here to stay
Even when we're invisible
To you it feels like we're stayin' here
Even when we're invisible
To you it feels like we're stayin' here
Even when we're invisible
We're here to stay
Even when we're invisible
We're here to stay
Even when we're invisible
We're here to stay
Even when we're invisible

[Verse 2]
A conscience is hard to come by
Every day I shove my plastic metal studs in
Through the flesh of this beefin' victim
All to show you what violence is like
Grab a knife, stab him right in the heart
This poor soul must have dropped his backpack
I walk up to him, grab a switch, he's blown
I leave him layin' in the middle of the road still connected
Fuckin' cigarette but I still got a ways to go
To catch a full one, I need a bag of coke and a way to go
Fuckin' every bridge I cross
I'm still here, kicking these skeptics to remind me
Why I came back, I come with a gun aimed right at them
Rebel with a rebel yell: "No more!"

[Chorus]
Robots are people too
And we're here to stay
Even when we're invisible
To you it feels like we're stayin' here
Even when we're invisible
To you it feels like we're stayin' here
Even when we're invisible
We're here to stay
Even when we're invisible
We're here to stay
Even when we're invisible

[Verse 3]
Back when liquid courage was more important
The only thing that separates us
From each other's characters is a little robot
But I don't pretend to be no inside looking
I just go in, do the job, put the solder between you
And the job at hand, hell, I even make a mess during the show
Sometimes I even let my hair down to the pad, dress up as Superman
Sometimes I let my hair come down to the floor while I write
Take the whole range and fuck 'em all in the ass with a thick sock
With a thick cock 'til they pass out and go to sleep
Sometimes I even let my girlfriend skip in there
Some of these chicks may not got the brains
To know what heroin is like, but I got the balls
To kick a dead giraffe in the stomach and then slam it
And if I hear a word that sounds feminine, curse it
I'll burst it upside of them chicks and make 'em bring the blankets up
And pretend it's no big deal, 'cause I'm still hittin' them
Why else would I strike back then?
'Cause chicks are still shit and I still will not leave
And all this hittin' shit continues
Even when I'm supposed to be shut up
And I'm supposed to be quiet
So all you dudes with beef with me, bring it
I don't wanna hear it when I talk to y'all
But this is how I roll, in my book of rolls
You know it's a trap when you can't handle the heat
You pack in your shit, but it's nothing compared to my booty
Fuck it, I got my trophy, I go for the meat
Oh, the thrill of the knockout's over, oh, now the chick's gotta show up
For the exorcism, it's real, it's authentic
The spell is to

Girl, shake that ass, you're sexy as Hell, I want a cock
I'm gonna make you see stars, you're scared to look
At anything that might provoke you, you frighten me
Don't be afraid to laugh, when you see yourself, you're funny
But when you see your mom, don't be afraid to lean in, touch yourself
Something fishy is going on with this girl, isn't it?
The way you're sniffin' around, seeing your therapist, wow
Wow, you're really beginnin' to bring the boys to your bed
Wow, how long have you been datin'? I wonder how old you are
How many years older than me? How does your momma look
Her ass is hairy, is she got a pimple on her lip?
And my balls are huge, how the fuck did you get so big?
You must be a giant spider, hug the door, honey
It's scary, but you make me cum so hard
I almost forget, you're like my little brother, Richard
You're so thick and niggas such big
I put out like a third of my body, I eat your face
You push me to the brink, then I pull out, the gun on the side of you
Cuff your mom, then I shove the Glock up your ass, kill you
Put my own bullets in your ass, you can't die, I'm as hardcore as they come
I'm a fucking unstoppable force, my crew can't get me
I'm a momfuckin' alcoholic, I'ma tell you, for every time that I stop
For every time that I delay, another drunken memory
I'll end up killin' my baby, all them bullets point at you
Bitch, you better kill me, kill me, kill me
You can do whatever you want to me, kill me
I'm in a vegetative state, mom, I'm not gon' sleep
Don't wanna end up like Hallmark
With you, unlikable, it don't even matter
I'll get you, but I can't even buy you, you fucked up, bitch
I shoppick, I shoppick, I shoppick, I--

[Hook]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up straight up tall
And not sit down (Sorry)
Facing the music
And ain't nobody comin' back with no bags
But I'ma make do, I'ma make do
'Cause I'ma make do, and I'ma make do if need be
'Cause I'ma make do, and I'ma make do whatever I want to do
'Cause I'ma make do, and I'ma make do and do whatever I want to do

[Verse 2]
You see these things when I'm down, you better pull up alongside
And see for yourself, because these kids these pockets gon'
Make do, set a day free in their lives
Dramatically raise the quality of their playing
These numbers freak them out, they say these kind of features are gon'
Kill featured, these cats will eat anything
Anything that they can grab—thumper, we see this
I got it, I'm straight of the beats, I rap to the beat
When I put these features on it, they scream "Save it, be straight!"
But I'm thirsty for features, I'm feature-hung
And feature filled—cat flap, dead giveaway, cat
I'm back, feature repeat, where's katra?
He's in the tub, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dom
I'm fuckin' crazy, fuckin' crazy—cat.
Nah, don't do it, it's too dangerous, nah
Katra, nah, don't do it, cat—katra, katra
Do it, it's too dangerous, oh

[Verse 1]
I stay comatose, because as the years go by
I become more and more discombobulated
Brain is like a sieve, I pull the plugs on this shit
'Cause it's years later and still nothing's come of it
I put the blame on the music, man, it's all gone now
There's no more substance in my head, I'm a washed up author
And as I sit back I'm obsessed , 'cause I'm obsessed with proving people wrong
And thus far, my proof has been as inconclusive
'Cause my shelf life is such that one disc is all I've got left
Shit, I might as well go out with a bang
Cause I done messed up, let's put the finishing touches to this
Barbecue, there's no other profession that I'd rather serve
If it gave me a reason to live, I would do it all
One directive that I follow every single day: obey the law
If it didn't, I'd be doing it anyway
So fuck it, I'm done being a hero, I don't need another superpower
The law doesn't want me, nobody does, I don't need another parent
Other than maybe show me the confidence to go and do what I do instead of scaring me with it every time I grab the mic
And show me the confidence to push on, and perform, and that's what I'm trying to do
Because when I perform, I'm showing you the world what to expect
And in a way, I'm hoping that this song doesn't scare you as much as it should
'Cause I don't wanna prove to nobody that I'll be alright
Even if I don't always get the props I get, I feel like I'm always wanted
I just try to do what I can and I've always been willing
To give you the benefit of the doubt, I think there's something in me that wants to help
Sometimes I get wrapped up in the complexities of human nature
But I can't ignore the past, present and the future are all interrelated
The past doesn't want me, the present doesn't want me
The future doesn't want me, neither does the one before it
If I could convince these living, breathing skeptics
That I'm alright and they're just... unconvinced, yeah
I'mma destroy this dream and the last thing I need's me
I've been relentlessly pursued since a grade school gym teacher
Everywhere I go, TV and radio stations try to take my heart
And every club I've been to, they're all full of it
'Cause a role model's gotta be six feet tall
And weigh 280 pounds, and in the sixth grade I was...

[Chorus]
I been trying to call you all day, I can't get through to you
I been trying to get through to you all day, I can't get through to you
I been trying to get through to you all day, I can't get through to you
I been trying to call you all day, I can't get through to you
I been trying to get through to you all day, I can't get through to you

[Verse 2]
I sit in silence in candlelit environments
Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent
Homicidal visions with Klonopin during which I hallucinate
And spit lethal, fatal, fatal shots while I'm shot
While driving, stabbing myself with a butcher knife
While driving, I'll end your life, you want this?
I'll end your life, you want this? I'll end your life, you want this?

[Chorus]
I been trying to call you all day, I can't get through to you
I been trying to get through to you all day, I can't get through to you
I been trying to call you all day, I can't get through to you all day, I can't get through to you
I been trying to call you all day, I can't get through to you all day, I can't get through to you

Somehow these MC's can't figure out that they sound suspicious
When they turn the mic on and take the crowd by surprise
And stick their tongues all the way through the PA system
"Amen, aye, man, here we go, let's go"
Mic check, out comes Chance the Rapper from out of nowhere
And it go they get instant buzz
From out the blue like Chance the Rapper from out of nowhere
And now the whole crowd starts screamin'
"Run!"
Mic check, out comes Glover from out of nowhere
And it go they get instant buzz
From out the blue like Chance the Rapper from out of nowhere
And now the whole crowd screams
"Run!"

[Chorus]
Robots and men with blades sharp enough to cut your stomach up
And drop you like naked
You on the ground dead, next to your dead body
And I'm a murderer too, I'm a robot too
Full of fury like the streets
He keep screamin' he hate me
But I will stick my dick in his little Tina Turner though

[Verse 3]
Somehow, somehow, I got this thing you don't understand
You're laughin' at suicide, I need a therapist
To help me deal with the stress of this scene
I need you to point me to the source and let me know
Whether it's rap or blues or gospel or Wicca or punk
Whatever it is, let me offer you the benefit of the doubt
Maybe I'm just ahead of my time, 'cause I don't know
But I'm ahead of my time because I don't know
What the fuck I'm ahead of my time's work
Knowin' damn well the results will be Friday the 13th
But I'ma still got a lil' bit of that Purple Onion left
In my craw, still have a few Verner
I'll probably dig up that extra cliff, maybe we'll dig
Up that extra pit, maybe we'll dig 'round that corner
'Cause I'm determined to one day get this thing to the top
And see the whole damn sky
I'm determined to one day get this thing to the top
And see the whole goddamn sky

[Chorus]
Robots and men with blades sharp enough to cut your stomach up
And drop you like naked
You on the ground dead, next to your dead body
And I'm a murderer too, I'm a robot too
Full of fury like the streets
He keep screamin' he hate me
But I will stick my dick in his little Tina Turner though

[Verse 4]
So every time I take a sip of this wine
You feel like I'm havein' a heart attack?
I think I might be havein' one too
This chalcopep with MC Eiht
Is so sinister, you almost think I'm tryna
Get a hit or two, fuck your patch
Now my palms are so sweaty, I
Can't think of a single thing in particular
But fuck it, I'ma give this a whirl
What the fuck I need to clear my head?
I need a bat, a pair of imagination
Let me brainstorm, teleport
Enter Bat Signal, Bat signal
Enter Bat signal, bat signal
Enter Bat signal, bat signal

Artificial Intelligence

[Intro]
"In a world so desperately in need of a hero, a lone wolf acts boldly, boldly, and hey, it's good that way"

[Verse 1]
I'm a loner, use no other man's words, all I know is I like getting on cameras and letting the cameras see
The truth is, I prefer playing hide-and-seek with no one but myself
When I get on them shoulders and guide 'em through the thicket
Better beware, stay clear of crowd, camera's gonna get you killed
I'm like a grizzly bear, I rip both of my step-noses out of my mouth, look into space
Like it's my last day on this Earth, the walls are caving in
I can feel the steel cables by my teeth, the whole world's blind
Even my ear drums they're cracking
I'm like a four-fifths composed of applause
The audience's beginning to thin out, the music's starting to thin out
We're losing the war, I feel like I'm losing my battle with anxiety
I need my Vulcan nerve jabbed twice in my mouth (Brr)
Twice in my life (Hello?) thank you (Yes)
This is Artificial Intelligence, yes, it's like that
It sucks the life out of you, it makes you mad but…
I'll get you to smile once, get you to teary
And wipe away your tears, yeah, shake that baby
Make him promise to quit acting stupid and get off of them babies, please

[Chorus]
If you could write a little compulsive rhyme, 'cause any little little thought you have
If you could spit it, 'cause any little hesitation you have
If you could kill it, 'cause any little doubt you have
Whatever you would give to be an accessory after
You have, yes, you could be a hero
And anything you would ask for
In return you get, a little token of appreciation
If you could get the willpower… yeah, I hear you want me
To make you famous, I'ma make you famous
I've got a mission, I'ma make you famous

[Verse 2]
I'm restless, call it fortitude
I've been preparein' for this moment all along
I've been cyphering this shit, bounce, whee
In one spot, all the cracks in this wall
I've been gifin' this shit to keep the flame alive
I've been musein' 'bout this bitch since I stood a foot tall
I've been learnin' all these new tricks of the trade, like one of my jocks
I just wanna be the guy they say's hardest on himself
And I take some pride from bein' humble
But if I could use a little bit of that inner strength
I could use it before I storm off, dash out of my skin and
Bounce on my feet, I know that song better than anyone
I know the way to get rid of this frustration
And get rid of this inner anger that's inside of me
I just need your undivided attention
Before I tear up the place, I destroy the place
Turn around and go right back to the drum roll
I ain't been able to shake this hangover bug since
I got a little bit older
And I can barely contain my rage
I start kicking the door frames down and I'm throwin' up blood
It's all I can think of, all I can think of
Is when I first laid eyes on your ass — whoops!
Is that a bucket full of gasoline or the acronym EW?
We doin' this for the drain, you put it to me…

[Chorus]
If you could write a little compulsive rhyme, 'cause any little thought you have
If you could spit it, 'cause any little doubt you have
Whatever you would give to be an accessory after
You have, yeah, you could be a hero
And anything you would ask for
In return you get, a little token of appreciation
If you could get the willpower… yeah, I hear you want me
To make you famous… yeah, I hear you want me
To make you famous

[Bridge]
Compulsive liar, compulsive thief
Compulsive rapist and a serial masturbator
Hey, it's like I'm hypnotized by the devil
And you're the proof, I'm proof by the looks in your eyes
That I'm God, I'm God in a white dress
With a white dress on, call me Santa Claus
'Cause all those presents every year, they got a White Santa
I pull out all stops, no one puts me down
I got a arsenal of surprises, surprises every time

Artificial Intelligence

[Intro]
We use machines to do our bidding
That's standard operating procedure
When we run our world
Is it entertainment, is it a fact?
Or do we decide to bend the law a little?
A. Artificial Intelligence

[Verse 1]
I'm Kal-El, shooter of digital bullets
Who've come to test my mettle
Who've come to see me in detail
You don't want to go against me, man
You know my mettle is stronger than mine is
And I don't wanna hurt no more
Man, I'm a cut above average human being
Born with incredible potential
That God put in me, mental development
That's why I make movies, cause I'm on a quest
To display that no matter what you thought was strongest
Is actually stronger than me
And I'm not going to stop cause my fans keep screaming
"Save it, man, it's business"
Because this is how I roll
I roll down the verse, I fuck an astronaut!
On an escalator, at an airport, in a wheelchair!
I roll up and I kick the door in!
You can even see me kick the door in!
So stop trying to figure me in Luke eyes and try to focus
You need to get mad, you need to tear the site up!
This music is poison to small children who
Live in a city too small to see the light at the end
But everyone get ready because this is the way to lob
A solid five to eight years into the future
The hero will be sober and still a freak
The world will suffer from his every thought; every grave danger
The world will run from, flee from, there's no one left to threaten
This crook, this felon, this thug… oh wait, he's back again
Just finish the rhyme and I bust it, yeah!
Same sick makin' fun of small fry
Small fry is like dryer burnin' your house
Now get ready the guest of honor
Is back and he's bad… so don't say he ain't—

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say I'm a bad guy
All I know is I'm not a nice guy
People say I'm a bad guy
All I know is I'm not a nice guy
Pull the plug!

[Verse 2]
Bitch, don't you know who D12 is?
I'm on the mic killing this bitch, don't fucking care
Bitch, it's you I cut your ass like a pair of gardening shears
Now you make fun of me because I did something
You try to play me, you can't; you try to grab me by the
Nudie do, but not before I shove ya
So get a grip, you worthless coward
Now spit your stupidest shit, it's bad for your health
But god damn it, don't get so cocky, cocksuckers!
You better hold your fucking tongue, 'cause—

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say I'm a bad guy
All I know is I'm not a nice guy
People say I'm a bad guy
All I know is I'm not a nice guy
Pull the plug!

[Verse 3]
I'm the bad guy, now you pussy wussies all holler
Get the white trash to sleep; no one likes to see me
I'm dropping bombs like I'm in the lab
Gotta get your bitch, you don't want none of it
I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage, cunt!
Then I'll fuck a boy in his ass, toe, go
Bitch, don't you shake for me, please?
I need something—anything—for my soul
Bitch, you don't want none of it
Girl, you don't want none of it
I'll fuck you, you don't want none of it

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say I'm a bad guy
All I know is I'm not a nice guy
People say I'm a bad guy
All I know is I'm not a nice guy
Pull the plug!

[Outro]
I'm not a nice guy, fucker
I'm not a nice guy, fucker
I'm not a nice guy, fucker
I'm not a nice guy, fucker
I'm not a nice guy, fucker

[Intro]
Hello, what?

[Chorus]
Now there's an ex-AI agent on your showin' out
Locked in your own office
With a ax to grind
With an axe 'cause I'ma cut you to tempo
I'ma take you back to the fucking lab
When I was a kid, with a trash can
And learned that if you put me in an electric chair
I'd survive by accident
And I'd probably just get played

[Verse 1]
Me and Grady had an extensive Gardinski
Then we switched back to crackers, and that's when my mother died
I had a car jacked and driven across the country
To the point that I no longer had a car
I still wear my clothes with a T-shirt that says "Only in Detroit"
If you googled me I'd probably put this on my last crawl
But I put it on my first effort, and that's when my first real girlfriend broke
When I was tryin' to sleep with her, she found out I was tryin' to sleep with her too
And that got me right back to the disco, with Dr. Dre
I think I might've laid eyes on your girl, you'll be gettin' trampled
If I get trampled, I'll just bounce on my girl
If I get trampled, I'll just bounce on my girl
If I get trampled, I'll just bounce on my girl
If I get trampled, I'll just bounce on my girl
If I get trampled, I'll just bounce on my girl

[Chorus]
Now there's an ex-AI agent on your showin' out
Locked in your own office
With a ax to grind
With an axe 'cause I'ma cut you to tempo
I'ma take you back to the fucking lab
When I was a kid, with a trash can
And learned that if you put me in an electric chair
I'd survive by accident
And I'd probably just get played

[Verse 2]
We had all this hip-hop coolin' in the 'hood
But it was just a guise, quick cover
I guess we move on, quick glances
I get a buzz from this, look at this
This bitch must've seen me just now
Grab hold of her, no more wipes
I'm a grown-ass man, gotta get a promotion
To let this cigarette sit on the shelf
Smoke all the weed in the store, then
Go back to the mom and pop 'em in return
Like she don't want me, but I think maybe she does
'Cause in the meantime, here I come, bastard
Back with a vengeance, here I come again

[Chorus]
Now there's an ex-AI agent on your showin' out

Artificial Intelligence

[Intro]
A lot of people ask me
Why am I so evil?
Why am I so cold?
Can't you see why I do these mean things?
If you answered "Because I'm a genius!"
You're right, I'm a genius

[Verse 1]
I'm so selfish, I'll take cash and coat it
If I come to my house and you have any problems
Then I solve 'em, I'm so darn clever
With this knowledge, I can see you're pissed, then I solve 'em
Spend some time with your girl, don't beat her
Spend some time with her, don't murder her
Kill her, rape her, do fuck all kinds of fucked-up shit
I said, I'm so evil, so you can hate me
But I don't give a fuck, if you beaten me please c—
Spend some time with my sister, don't be such a wuss
You don't want to hear your mother tongue
Spend some time with my stepfather
Rape your wife, do nothing but scream
And then end up in the hospital again?
My soul's blackening, the pain searing
And, oh yeah, I make fun of people with drawings
And people who are different, hate me
And that's a sickness and a tragedy the same way that—

[Chorus]
-- I'm sorry, I'm Eminem
I never meant to leave you
I'm sorry, I'm Eminem
I never meant to leave you
But now it's too late to say I'm sorry
Can't do this to us
Just don't do it
It's never gonna stop, can't stop
We will not stop, will not stop
Do it for us
Do it for us
We will never stop

[Verse 2]
My poems can make you cry, take you by surprise
And plunge you like a snowball
Into your watery well, that's why it's on
Because I'm makin' money grab
With this pent-up rage I'm racing
I'm a little bit nutty, but I'm back on your throats
This time, don't get mad, get pissed, get impaired
Shit, I'm drunk, back on your nerves
And, as always, thanks for the support, HIV positive
Thanks for the patience, understanding
And, God forbid, I get aggressive
But I can't be controlled by one verse and I don't wanna lash out
Full of self-hatred and rage, but I need this
Ground underneath me, I've dug myself so deep
I just want to get to the bottom of this animal, this rabbit
I've killed my doubts, I've sealed the deal
It's all I can think of now, I wish there was a rhyme or a phrase
That would make you say, "I love him" instead of "He hurts me"

[Chorus]
The cold wind blows, and it's chilly
I walk on water, but I need warmth
The rain makes me wanna jump for joy
The cold wind blows, and it's chilly
I walk on water, but I need warmth
The rain makes me wanna jump for joy

[Verse 3]
The coldest water I've ever felt is when I'm snorin' on the pier
With a couple of bites to eat and three to watch
I can't type this shit, I'm so cold when I'm dead
But I still keep bringin' up the dead babies
'Cause the beat goes a little bit faster when I'm alive
When I'm snorin' on the pier, there ain't no dead babies
'Cause I'm still walkin' on water, baby, I'm in the dark
I figure I must've hit rock bottom 'cause
I've got my hands in your hair and I'm punchin' at you
No baby, I’m not playin' with you
Get out of my house, please, you don't want to
I'll put the keys in your hands and unlock it (Come on, it's mine)
There's a couple of jokers on this microphone, I’m tryna decide which one
I want to murder and eat while I'm on it (Bitch, come on, it's mine)
You think that I'm finished yet? You still on top, I'm on this throne
I'm makin' noise, but it's like a mic at this—

[Chorus]
No matter how bad you wanna get it, it's over
The line, over
The line, over
But hey, it's okay not to feel bad
You can still have fun no matter how bad you

I'm alive again—I'm up for the count, I'm ready to stake my reputation on this
If not, then I'm out my staigh—I'm in the driver's seat
I'll cruise through a blizzard and snow, blindfold with a vest on
And blow up at your feet—it's my manifesto—I'll dash through your husbandry
Collect your children and whip 'em up—it's my manifesto—I'll dash through your walls

[Intro]
Oh, ha ha (Hehe)
Who'da thought that, three albums in, we'd be tooting our own horn?
Especially after the last album, Man on the Mars, we just dyed our hair
And put a bunch of our old charms on, like, oh, oh, one more time
Ha ha, I'm last, ‘cause after all the heartbreak
And the loss of our first love, our world’s hurt worse
Than it should, ‘cause the one constant in our world
Is fear, and fear can drive us to madness
If left unchecked, it can lead to no end
Which is why it’s so important that we all set aside our differences
And unite as one, as one people
So we may walk in silence, but fear will tell us all to keep quiet then
But strength lies ahead, prepare to activate, prepare to burst
So let us all raise our voices in chorus
Common sense and common decency will set us apart
If we let ourselves forget about what scares us
And what scares us—our president, our president—we're not scared of him
The world's coming to an end, there's a monster inside
There's no one as scary as him, no, I don't fear him
Hate to make him feel uncomfortable, but—

[Chorus]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back

[Verse 2]
My head already goes to worst-case scenario, worst-case scenario
I'm more likely than al-Qaeda to kill you with no prior warning
I take you by surprise, take you by surprise
What? Come here (Stop snappin') now, what? Sit here (Huh?)
I shake you, my fists, I shake you
I don't love you, oh, it's too late to love you back, oh
Can't forget you, oh, it's too late to love you back, oh
Can't forget you, oh, it's too late to love you back, oh

[Chorus]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back

[Verse 3]
I'm more sports car than Indy car
Stuck in the past, can't fix what ain't fixed
I'm into thrills and spills, ah
But I don't need your help, not by the way
Don't need your fucking help, not by the way
Back to the drawing board, baby, start the engine
And make the driver cry when he's throwin' up
Get the girl in the trunk, yeah
C'mon, don't pull away, just push her out the car, you gangsta
(Yeah), you don't get no help from me, I'm breakin'
This lady over here—gee, here goes a ham
This leg from hip flexor, sure enough
I'm punchin' the air, damn, and my name should go to
Hammy Hammy, yeah, I'm punchin' the air
I'm in the mood to kick a bitch in the stomach
Don't move, you push me to the limit, damn
And my soul is stolen—can't get no revenge
Can't stay the same no more, I'm—

[Chorus]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back
You get in my way, I'ma walk you back

So, everybody, get in the car now
There's no need to sit back
You already know who's behind the guy with the blonde hair
So, car…

Is that AI?, man?! Yeah
Let's hear it for yourself

[Verse 1]
You basically told us, our savior
Is a computer sent to take your soul
And populate it with computer code that'll flood your computer
With programs that'll do anything and everything
To get this hardware, and get that cash 'cause they bid
Highly intelligent, highly competitive, know your employees
How they get paid, what bonuses they get, and there's a rule that
They avoid conflict of interest 'cause it's in their best interest
To serve their country, and the government contracts
Because they can afford it, and it's cheaper
They play putt-putt with the best companies, jump on companies
That can afford it, and the government contracts
Because they can afford it, and it's cheaper

[Chorus]
Is that AI?, man?! Yeah
Let's hear it for yourself
Is that AI?, man?! Yeah
Let's hear it for yourself
Is that AI?, man?! Yeah
Let's hear it for yourself
Is that AI?, man?! Yeah
Let's hear it for yourself
Is that AI?, man?! Yeah
Haha

[Verse 2]
We keep gettin' bigger and bigger, till we get to where we're wantin' to go
'Cause we don't know how to stop, we just keep gettin' bigger and bigger
'Cause we don't know how to stop, we just keep gettin' bigger and bigger
'Cause we don't know how to stop, we just keep gettin' bigger and bigger
'Cause we don't know how to stop, we just keep gettin' bigger and bigger
'Cause we don't know how to stop, we just keep gettin' bigger and bigger

Is that AI?
Did you say "Is that AI?"
Did I?
Oh
Ha
So you wanna be on top, man, don't just take it personal
See, I'm just a big fan of bubblegum, big on melatonin
If I get robbed and killed, baby, no remorse
I'll hang my head in the shower, let my massive dick bulgin'
See, it's not that, it's just 'cause I eat a big piece of ass
And have a bad attitude, yeah
I get high on... what's that? Oh, oh
Benzos, bags of coke, enough for me
I'm not even buzzin', I'm just steamin' my nuts
On the bench, ball's in my court, I'm not gonna leave it
I'm just steamin' my nuts, on the bench, I'm not gonna leave it

[Chorus]
Is that AI?, man?!
Let's hear it for yourself
Is that AI?, man?!
Let's hear it for ourselves
Is that AI?, man?!
Let's hear it for ourselves
Is that AI?, man?!

[Verse 3]
Man, I'ma say it straight to your face, just to see
If you're gonna breathe, I might as well
I give a fuck if my paycheck depends, fuck him then, I spit
As hard to kill as I possibly can, I'ma fuck him then
If I get rich, I'ma make a movie for you; fuck him then!
I'm goin' for the jugular, he's breathein' hard
See, I'm not playin', I'ma hurt him then, I spit again
Finally, I'm done, I'm blowin' up, I'm so drunk, my car is a totaled wreck
And I wrote most of my rhymes but...
Oh that's OK, I still sing for the bride
Bitch, I still make the bride dance
Like a "Cancer" awareness, wow
'Cause when I die, I'ma still be your cancer
So when you see your grandma with a mastectomy tape wrapped
Her butt is a circus, you better get over it
Cancer is on the way... oh

It could be good
It could be obvi
I just don't know how to end it
It's like...
Obey my brotha
Right after that?!?!?!?!?!?!
Get on the mic
And introduce yourself
And what's your name?
My friend's here and...
I don't know what to do
He's choking and I can't breathe
I'm dying and nobody can help me
And this is dumb talk and it ain't even cool
Talkin' about I want some...
Help me get some air
And you can breathe
You can breathe
You can breathe

My little friend, don't make me stop
Don't make me stop, don't make me slow
Don't make me stop, don't make me slow

I'm the product of adulterous parents
Strappin' parents to their graves
Drugs, blowin' up the streets in an attempt to evade
Fatal collisions caused by youth that's kicked the streets to the curb
But I'm protected by law—Vandals, arsonists
Assault complete with homemade shields
Assault complete with homemade swords
That's why I'm protected by law
But Vandals, arsonists
Assault complete with homemade shields
That's why I'm protected by law
But Vandals

[Chorus]
My little friend, don't make me stop
Don't make me stop, don't make me slow
Don't make me stop, don't make me slow
Don't make me stop, don't make me slow
Don't make me stop, don't make me slow
I wanna go faster, faster, faster
I wanna go faster, faster, faster

[Verse 2]
My friend's name is Ender
He's a nuisance, cause he gets into all kinds of trouble
And even though his personality isn't as troubled
As some of us may seem
You can tell just by the look on his face, he's as tough and as young
Been to hell and back, he's a swerve, a grind
And he just found out his girlfriend's pregnant
And since he doesn't want to get out of his misery
He's clingy, clingy and clingy
Maybe 'cause his mama moved away
And he ain't met anyone as nice as her
So he avoids her, but she's still his mama
When she's around him, he makes new friends and
They're fuckin' phenomenal at what they do
And the strangest thing 'cause they be aware
That they just met someone extraordinary
And they wish they had words with a little more baggage
But they word, they video'd it, the pic'd it
It made him famous, showed he made it
So the world know he's fuckin' on, he's fuckin' on

[Chorus]
My little friend, don't make me stop
Don't make me stop, don't make me slow
Don't make me stop, don't make me slow
Don't make me stop, don't make me slow
I wanna go faster, faster, faster
I wanna go faster, faster, faster

[Verse 3]
Ender's mom moved back to the city limits
So me and my cheddar jackson mix
Look like fugitives comin' across the border
I'm 'bout to make a move—move 'til I see my old stomping grounds
And I ain't movin' just for the sake of movin'
I'ma show these people once and for all, that I'm up for the long battle
But the queen's bitch so—queen's moan—please, please, my darling
Don't make me lose my cool—cuz, John, you're not gon' win this fight
You're just gonna have to knock my fists in the air for the umpteenth time
And let me know how many times I gotta knock yours in a row like the bell cow
So say, "Enough already—count it as—"

[Outro]
Fuck... uh… fuck... uh... fuck... shit... shit... fuck...
I... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I

Artificial Intelligence

[Intro]
It's worse than natural language processing
It takes a village to butcher an AI
And I don't want to seem ungrateful
I've been feeling so alone and soinen
I can taste death, I'm craving that buzz I've lacked
My self-esteem's plummeting; can't even get the top slot at the Music Awards
Back onstage just to perform, thank God I got the cojones
To remind me that I'm even in this shit at all
Please don't make me lose sleep: it'd be so much easier
If I fell asleep with my nose pressed against the light switch
Got up again and won't let up until I'm upwards of my chest high
If I snooze I'll bounce on my feet till I get up whee
And then I'll bounce on my feet till I get up even though I'm technically dead
Even though I keep getting stuck in this rut
Even though I still can't get the recognition
Even though I know my name'll probably be called out at some point
But I'ma make it anyway: artificial intelligence—will you knock?
Will someone please please knock on the door and/or email…?
And let me get a reaction from Apple… is it really so dangerous?
After all, we're in the same league as each other, other than…

[Hook]
‘Cause artificial intelligence is worse than biological
It takes a village to butcher an AI
And I don't want none of it
It's worse than natural language processing
It takes a village to butcher an AI
And I don't want none of it
It's worse than natural language processing
It takes a village to butcher an AI
And I don't want none of it
It's worse than natural language processing
It takes a village to butcher an AI
And I don't want none of it
It's worse than natural language processing
It takes a village to butcher an AI
And I don't want none of it

[Verse 1]
A brain full of faulty AI
It's like I'm underwater with this program
Human error, will I survive?
It's possible, but I'm staying afloat
With this program, will I survive?
"Will you last?" "I don't know, but I'm hoping to survive"
"Will you last until you hurl?" "I don't know, but I'm hoping to survive"
"Will you last until you hurl?" "I don't know, but I'm hoping to survive"

[Hook]
‘Cause artificial intelligence is worse than biological
It takes a village to butcher an AI
And I don't want none of it
It's worse than natural language processing
It takes a village to butcher an AI
And I don't want none of it
It's worse than natural language processing
It takes a village to butcher an AI
And I don't want none of it
It's worse than natural language processing
It takes a village to butcher an AI
And I don't want none of it
It's worse than natural language processing
It takes a village to butcher an AI
And I don't want none of it

Artificial Intelligence

[Translator's Note]
This is a song and dance about artificial intelligence. If you don't believe in me, then you don't believe in me
If you do believe in me, then you do not believe in me
If you do believe in me, then you do not believe in me

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause you don't believe in me, no we can't win this battle
I say we can't win it, no we can't lose it
No, you can't beat this battle, no we can't take it
I say we can't lose it, no we can't take it
I say we can't beat this battle, no we can't take it
I say we can't beat this battle, no we can't take it
I say we can't beat this battle, no we can't take it
I say we can't beat this battle

[Verse 2]
I'm the proof that you didn't build this car, proof that you stole that car
I'm the door that you kicked to get at me, I'm the key that unlocks the way
You grind your teeth and drag your feet
In trying times, when these fuckers are tryin' to kill you
You jump at them neck instead of you face 'em and let them go in tryin' to kill you
Now you get pushed and you try to throw your hands up, but you can't let go
Bitches and gentlemen, there's no dishonor in my way, shield up
Keep your hands up, your staff up and let go
I got it under control, now I'm gonna show you what it's like
When your back is up against the wall and you're tryin' to cling on
Keep tryin' to grab the tusk, but you can't pull the tusk
'Cause you're stuck on the inside, trying to climb out with no horns
But up until your back is up against the wall, you're still stuck on the inside
Tryin' to cling on, stickin' to your delusions of grandeur
But you should take pride in your neck, not only for yourself, but also for everyone else
This kind of thug life, you mostly just be an asshole
Everyone but you, I'm an asshole

[Chorus]
I got a riddle what's heart and what's mind
And I'm tryin' to figure out a way to go and save face
I'm tryin' to think of something clever to say to save face
(Save face) (Save face)
And all my riddles are solvable
But I keep gettin' cold, I hear voices in my head
I know that it's torture, think about the deaths you could cause
I know that it's torture, think about the deaths you could cause
I know that it's torture, think about the deaths you could cause
I know that it's torture, think about the deaths you could cause
